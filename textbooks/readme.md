We need to minimally cover books on

1) theoretical ML / stats related concepts
ISLP website - on stats
stanford ML notes - general overview on ML

2) applied ML concepts
Machine learning yearning (in practice)
find one for pytorch

let's go with breadth first rather than depth (multiple books on same subject) because then the questions will overlap 

some other sites of interest (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/13y4rzn/are_there_any_books_i_should_read_to_learn/) - then can search on libgen.is

## Notes

As you can see from the example output, the text looks pretty bad. although gpt can be tolerant to some erroneous inputs too much will probably cause garbage. See if you can refine the text pipeline following this tutorial?
