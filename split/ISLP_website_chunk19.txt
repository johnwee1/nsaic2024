The Carseats data includes qualitative predictors such as ShelveLoc, an
indicator of the quality of the shelving location — that is, the space within
a store in which the car seat is displayed. The predictor ShelveLoc takes on
three possible values, Bad, Medium, and Good. Given a qualitative variable
such as ShelveLoc, ModelSpec() generates dummy variables automatically.
These variables are often referred to as a one-hot encoding of the categorical
one-hot
feature. Their columns sum to one, so to avoid collinearity with an inter- encoding
cept, the first column is dropped. Below we see the column ShelveLoc[Bad]
has been dropped, since Bad is the first level of ShelveLoc. Below we fit a
multiple regression model that includes some interaction terms.

In the first line above, we made allvars a list, so that we could add the
interaction terms two lines down. Our model-matrix builder has created a
ShelveLoc[Good] dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the shelving
location is good, and 0 otherwise. It has also created a ShelveLoc[Medium]
dummy variable that equals 1 if the shelving location is medium, and 0 otherwise. A bad shelving location corresponds to a zero for each of the two
dummy variables. The fact that the coefficient for ShelveLoc[Good] in the
regression output is positive indicates that a good shelving location is associated with high sales (relative to a bad location). And ShelveLoc[Medium]
has a smaller positive coefficient, indicating that a medium shelving location leads to higher sales than a bad shelving location, but lower sales than
a good shelving location.

Exercises

Conceptual
1. Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4
correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these
p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV,
radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the
linear model.
2. Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN
regression methods.
3. Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, X1 = GPA, X2 =
IQ, X3 = Level (1 for College and 0 for High School), X4 = Interaction between GPA and IQ, and X5 = Interaction between GPA and
Level. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands
of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get
β̂0 = 50, β̂1 = 20, β̂2 = 0.07, β̂3 = 35, β̂4 = 0.01, β̂5 = −10.
(a) Which answer is correct, and why?
i. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn
more, on average, than college graduates.
ii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn
more, on average, than high school graduates.

iii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, high school graduates earn
more, on average, than college graduates provided that the
GPA is high enough.
iv. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, college graduates earn
more, on average, than high school graduates provided that
the GPA is high enough.
(b) Predict the salary of a college graduate with IQ of 110 and a
GPA of 4.0.
(c) True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction
term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction
effect. Justify your answer.
4. I collect a set of data (n = 100 observations) containing a single
predictor and a quantitative response. I then fit a linear regression
model to the data, as well as a separate cubic regression, i.e. Y =
β0 + β1 X + β2 X 2 + β3 X 3 + ".
(a) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is linear,
i.e. Y = β0 + β1 X + ". Consider the training residual sum of
squares (RSS) for the linear regression, and also the training
RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower
than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there
not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.
(b) Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.
(c) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is not linear,
but we don’t know how far it is from linear. Consider the training
RSS for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the
cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the
other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not
enough information to tell? Justify your answer.
(d) Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.
5. Consider the fitted values that result from performing linear regression without an intercept. In this setting, the ith fitted value takes
the form
ŷi = xi β̂,
where
β̂ =

6. Using (3.4), argue that in the case of simple linear regression, the
least squares line always passes through the point (x̄, ȳ).
7. It is claimed in the text that in the case of simple linear regression
of Y onto X, the R2 statistic (3.17) is equal to the square of the
correlation between X and Y (3.18). Prove that this is the case. For
simplicity, you may assume that x̄ = ȳ = 0.

(h) Is there evidence of outliers or high leverage observations in the
model from (e)?
11. In this problem we will investigate the t-statistic for the null hypothesis H0 : β = 0 in simple linear regression without an intercept. To
begin, we generate a predictor x and a response y as follows.
rng = np.random.default_rng (1)
x = rng.normal(size =100)
y = 2 * x + rng.normal(size =100)

(a) Perform a simple linear regression of y onto x, without an intercept. Report the coefficient estimate β̂, the standard error of
this coefficient estimate, and the t-statistic and p-value associated with the null hypothesis H0 : β = 0. Comment on these
results. (You can perform regression without an intercept using
the keywords argument intercept=False to ModelSpec().)

circumstance is the coefficient estimate for the regression of X
onto Y the same as the coefficient estimate for the regression of
