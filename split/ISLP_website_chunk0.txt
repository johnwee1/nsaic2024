An Overview of Statistical Learning
Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. These
tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking,
supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for predicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs. Problems of
this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and
public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but
no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and structure from such data. To provide an illustration of some applications of
statistical learning, we briefly discuss three real-world data sets that are
considered in this book.

Wage Data
In this application (which we refer to as the Wage data set throughout this
book), we examine a number of factors that relate to wages for a group of
men from the Atlantic region of the United States. In particular, we wish
to understand the association between an employee’s age and education, as
well as the calendar year, on his wage. Consider, for example, the left-hand
panel of Figure 1.1, which displays wage versus age for each of the individuals in the data set. There is evidence that wage increases with age but then
decreases again after approximately age 60. The blue line, which provides
an estimate of the average wage for a given age, makes this trend clearer.
Given an employee’s age, we can use this curve to predict his wage. However,
it is also clear from Figure 1.1 that there is a significant amount of variability associated with this average value, and so age alone is unlikely to
provide an accurate prediction of a particular man’s wage.

Education Level

FIGURE 1.1. Wage data, which contains income survey information for men
from the central Atlantic region of the United States. Left: wage as a function of
age. On average, wage increases with age until about 60 years of age, at which
point it begins to decline. Center: wage as a function of year. There is a slow
but steady increase of approximately $10,000 in the average wage between 2003
and 2009. Right: Boxplots displaying wage as a function of education, with 1
indicating the lowest level (no high school diploma) and 5 the highest level (an
advanced graduate degree). On average, wage increases with the level of education.

We also have information regarding each employee’s education level and
the year in which the wage was earned. The center and right-hand panels
of Figure 1.1, which display wage as a function of both year and education,
indicate that both of these factors are associated with wage. Wages increase
by approximately $10,000, in a roughly linear (or straight-line) fashion,
between 2003 and 2009, though this rise is very slight relative to the variability in the data. Wages are also typically greater for individuals with
higher education levels: men with the lowest education level (1) tend to
have substantially lower wages than those with the highest education level
(5). Clearly, the most accurate prediction of a given man’s wage will be
obtained by combining his age, his education, and the year. In Chapter 3,
we discuss linear regression, which can be used to predict wage from this
data set. Ideally, we should predict wage in a way that accounts for the
non-linear relationship between wage and age. In Chapter 7, we discuss a
class of approaches for addressing this problem.

Stock Market Data
The Wage data involves predicting a continuous or quantitative output value.
This is often referred to as a regression problem. However, in certain cases
we may instead wish to predict a non-numerical value—that is, a categorical
or qualitative output. For example, in Chapter 4 we examine a stock market
data set that contains the daily movements in the Standard & Poor’s 500
(S&P) stock index over a 5-year period between 2001 and 2005. We refer
to this as the Smarket data. The goal is to predict whether the index will
increase or decrease on a given day, using the past 5 days’ percentage
changes in the index. Here the statistical learning problem does not involve
predicting a numerical value. Instead it involves predicting whether a given

day’s stock market performance will fall into the Up bucket or the Down
bucket. This is known as a classification problem. A model that could
accurately predict the direction in which the market will move would be
very useful!
The left-hand panel of Figure 1.2 displays two boxplots of the previous
day’s percentage changes in the stock index: one for the 648 days for which
the market increased on the subsequent day, and one for the 602 days for
which the market decreased. The two plots look almost identical, suggesting that there is no simple strategy for using yesterday’s movement in the
S&P to predict today’s returns. The remaining panels, which display boxplots for the percentage changes 2 and 3 days previous to today, similarly
indicate little association between past and present returns. Of course, this
lack of pattern is to be expected: in the presence of strong correlations between successive days’ returns, one could adopt a simple trading strategy
to generate profits from the market. Nevertheless, in Chapter 4, we explore
these data using several different statistical learning methods. Interestingly,
there are hints of some weak trends in the data that suggest that, at least
for this 5-year period, it is possible to correctly predict the direction of
movement in the market approximately 60% of the time (Figure 1.3).

Gene Expression Data
The previous two applications illustrate data sets with both input and
output variables. However, another important class of problems involves
situations in which we only observe input variables, with no corresponding
output. For example, in a marketing setting, we might have demographic
information for a number of current or potential customers. We may wish to
understand which types of customers are similar to each other by grouping
individuals according to their observed characteristics. This is known as a

FIGURE 1.3. We fit a quadratic discriminant analysis model to the subset
of the Smarket data corresponding to the 2001–2004 time period, and predicted
the probability of a stock market decrease using the 2005 data. On average, the
predicted probability of decrease is higher for the days in which the market does
decrease. Based on these results, we are able to correctly predict the direction of
movement in the market 60% of the time.

clustering problem. Unlike in the previous examples, here we are not trying
to predict an output variable.
We devote Chapter 12 to a discussion of statistical learning methods
for problems in which no natural output variable is available. We consider
the NCI60 data set, which consists of 6,830 gene expression measurements
for each of 64 cancer cell lines. Instead of predicting a particular output
variable, we are interested in determining whether there are groups, or
clusters, among the cell lines based on their gene expression measurements.
This is a difficult question to address, in part because there are thousands
of gene expression measurements per cell line, making it hard to visualize
the data.
The left-hand panel of Figure 1.4 addresses this problem by representing each of the 64 cell lines using just two numbers, Z1 and Z2 . These
are the first two principal components of the data, which summarize the
6,830 expression measurements for each cell line down to two numbers or
dimensions. While it is likely that this dimension reduction has resulted in
some loss of information, it is now possible to visually examine the data
for evidence of clustering. Deciding on the number of clusters is often a
difficult problem. But the left-hand panel of Figure 1.4 suggests at least
four groups of cell lines, which we have represented using separate colors.
In this particular data set, it turns out that the cell lines correspond
to 14 different types of cancer. (However, this information was not used
to create the left-hand panel of Figure 1.4.) The right-hand panel of Figure 1.4 is identical to the left-hand panel, except that the 14 cancer types
are shown using distinct colored symbols. There is clear evidence that cell
lines with the same cancer type tend to be located near each other in this
two-dimensional representation. In addition, even though the cancer information was not used to produce the left-hand panel, the clustering obtained
does bear some resemblance to some of the actual cancer types observed
in the right-hand panel. This provides some independent verification of the
accuracy of our clustering analysis.

A Brief History of Statistical Learning
Though the term statistical learning is fairly new, many of the concepts that
underlie the field were developed long ago. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the method of least squares was developed, implementing
the earliest form of what is now known as linear regression. The approach
was first successfully applied to problems in astronomy. Linear regression
is used for predicting quantitative values, such as an individual’s salary.
In order to predict qualitative values, such as whether a patient survives
or dies, or whether the stock market increases or decreases, linear discriminant analysis was proposed in 1936. In the 1940s, various authors put
forth an alternative approach, logistic regression. In the early 1970s, the
term generalized linear model was developed to describe an entire class of
statistical learning methods that include both linear and logistic regression
as special cases.
By the end of the 1970s, many more techniques for learning from data
were available. However, they were almost exclusively linear methods because fitting non-linear relationships was computationally difficult at the
time. By the 1980s, computing technology had finally improved sufficiently
that non-linear methods were no longer computationally prohibitive. In
the mid 1980s, classification and regression trees were developed, followed
shortly by generalized additive models. Neural networks gained popularity
in the 1980s, and support vector machines arose in the 1990s.
Since that time, statistical learning has emerged as a new subfield in
statistics, focused on supervised and unsupervised modeling and prediction.
In recent years, progress in statistical learning has been marked by the
increasing availability of powerful and relatively user-friendly software, such
as the popular and freely available Python system. This has the potential to
continue the transformation of the field from a set of techniques used and

developed by statisticians and computer scientists to an essential toolkit
for a much broader community.

This Book
The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and
Friedman was first published in 2001. Since that time, it has become an
important reference on the fundamentals of statistical machine learning.
Its success derives from its comprehensive and detailed treatment of many
important topics in statistical learning, as well as the fact that (relative to
many upper-level statistics textbooks) it is accessible to a wide audience.
However, the greatest factor behind the success of ESL has been its topical
nature. At the time of its publication, interest in the field of statistical
learning was starting to explode. ESL provided one of the first accessible
and comprehensive introductions to the topic.
Since ESL was first published, the field of statistical learning has continued to flourish. The field’s expansion has taken two forms. The most
obvious growth has involved the development of new and improved statistical learning approaches aimed at answering a range of scientific questions
across a number of fields. However, the field of statistical learning has
also expanded its audience. In the 1990s, increases in computational power
generated a surge of interest in the field from non-statisticians who were
eager to use cutting-edge statistical tools to analyze their data. Unfortunately, the highly technical nature of these approaches meant that the user
community remained primarily restricted to experts in statistics, computer
science, and related fields with the training (and time) to understand and
implement them.
In recent years, new and improved software packages have significantly
eased the implementation burden for many statistical learning methods.
At the same time, there has been growing recognition across a number of
fields, from business to health care to genetics to the social sciences and
beyond, that statistical learning is a powerful tool with important practical
applications. As a result, the field has moved from one of primarily academic
interest to a mainstream discipline, with an enormous potential audience.
This trend will surely continue with the increasing availability of enormous
quantities of data and the software to analyze it.
The purpose of An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) is to facilitate the transition of statistical learning from an academic to a mainstream
field. ISL is not intended to replace ESL, which is a far more comprehensive text both in terms of the number of approaches considered and the
depth to which they are explored. We consider ESL to be an important
companion for professionals (with graduate degrees in statistics, machine
learning, or related fields) who need to understand the technical details
behind statistical learning approaches. However, the community of users of
statistical learning techniques has expanded to include individuals with a
wider range of interests and backgrounds. Therefore, there is a place for a
less technical and more accessible version of ESL.
