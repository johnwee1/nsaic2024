given by
p((cid:126)y|X; θ). This quantity is typically viewed a function of (cid:126)y (and perhaps X),
for a ﬁxed value of θ. When we wish to explicitly view this as a function of
θ, we will instead call it the likelihood function:

L(θ) = L(θ; X, (cid:126)y) = p((cid:126)y|X; θ).

Note that by the independence assumption on the (cid:15)(i)’s (and hence also the
y(i)’s given the x(i)’s), this can also be written

L(θ) =

Now, given this probabilistic model relating the y(i)’s and the x(i)’s, what
is a reasonable way of choosing our best guess of the parameters θ? The
principal of maximum likelihood says that we should choose θ so as to
make the data as high probability as possible. I.e., we should choose θ to
maximize L(θ).

Instead of maximizing L(θ), we can also maximize any strictly increasing
function of L(θ). In particular, the derivations will be a bit simpler if we
instead maximize the log likelihood (cid:96)(θ):

which we recognize to be J(θ), our original least-squares cost function.

To summarize: Under the previous probabilistic assumptions on the data,
least-squares regression corresponds to ﬁnding the maximum likelihood esti-
mate of θ. This is thus one set of assumptions under which least-squares re-
gression can be justiﬁed as a very natural method that’s just doing maximum
likelihood estimation. (Note however that the probabilistic assumptions are
by no means necessary for least-squares to be a perfectly good and rational
procedure, and there may—and indeed there are—other natural assumptions
that can also be used to justify it.)

Note also that, in our previous discussion, our ﬁnal choice of θ did not
depend on what was σ2, and indeed we’d have arrived at the same result
even if σ2 were unknown. We will use this fact again later, when we talk
about the exponential family and generalized linear models.

1.4 Locally weighted linear regression (optional

reading)

Consider the problem of predicting y from x ∈ R. The leftmost ﬁgure below
shows the result of ﬁtting a y = θ0 + θ1x to a dataset. We see that the data
doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the ﬁt is not very good.

18

Instead, if we had added an extra feature x2, and ﬁt y = θ0 + θ1x + θ2x2,
then we obtain a slightly better ﬁt to the data. (See middle ﬁgure) Naively, it
might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also
a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost ﬁgure is the result of
ﬁtting a 5-th order polynomial y = (cid:80)5
j=0 θjxj. We see that even though the
ﬁtted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to
be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for diﬀerent living areas
(x). Without formally deﬁning what these terms mean, we’ll say the ﬁgure
on the left shows an instance of underﬁtting—in which the data clearly
shows structure not captured by the model—and the ﬁgure on the right is
an example of overﬁtting. (Later in this class, when we talk about learning
theory we’ll formalize some of these notions, and also deﬁne more carefully
just what it means for a hypothesis to be good or bad.)

As discussed previously, and as shown in the example above, the choice of
features is important to ensuring good performance of a learning algorithm.
(When we talk about model selection, we’ll also see algorithms for automat-
ically choosing a good set of features.) In this section, let us brieﬂy talk
about the locally weighted linear regression (LWR) algorithm which, assum-
ing there is suﬃcient training data, makes the choice of features less critical.
This treatment will be brief, since you’ll get a chance to explore some of the
properties of the LWR algorithm yourself in the homework.

In the original linear regression algorithm, to make a prediction at a query

point x (i.e., to evaluate h(x)), we would:

1. Fit θ to minimize (cid:80)

i(y(i) − θT x(i))2.

2. Output θT x.

In contrast, the locally weighted linear regression algorithm does the fol-

lowing:

1. Fit θ to minimize (cid:80)

i w(i)(y(i) − θT x(i))2.

2. Output θT x.

Here, the w(i)’s are non-negative valued weights. Intuitively, if w(i) is large
for a particular value of i, then in picking θ, we’ll try hard to make (y(i) −
θT x(i))2 small. If w(i) is small, then the (y(i) − θT x(i))2 error term will be
pretty much ignored in the ﬁt.

A fairly standard choice for the weights is4

w(i) = exp

(cid:18)

−

(x(i) − x)2
2τ 2

(cid:19)

Note that the weights depend on the particular point x at which we’re trying
to evaluate x. Moreover, if |x(i) − x| is small, then w(i) is close to 1; and
if |x(i) − x| is large, then w(i) is small. Hence, θ is chosen giving a much
higher “weight” to the (errors on) training examples close to the query point
x. (Note also that while the formula for the weights takes a form that is
cosmetically similar to the density of a Gaussian distribution, the w(i)’s do
not directly have anything to do with Gaussians, and in particular the w(i)
are not random variables, normally distributed or otherwise.) The parameter
τ controls how quickly the weight of a training example falls oﬀ with distance
of its x(i) from the query point x; τ is called the bandwidth parameter, and
is also something that you’ll get to experiment with in your homework.

Locally weighted linear regression is the ﬁrst example we’re seeing of a
non-parametric algorithm. The (unweighted) linear regression algorithm
that we saw earlier is known as a parametric learning algorithm, because
it has a ﬁxed, ﬁnite number of parameters (the θi’s), which are ﬁt to the
data. Once we’ve ﬁt the θi’s and stored them away, we no longer need to
keep the training data around to make future predictions. In contrast, to
make predictions using locally weighted linear regression, we need to keep
the entire training set around. The term “non-parametric” (roughly) refers
to the fact that the amount of stuﬀ we need to keep in order to represent the
hypothesis h grows linearly with the size of the training set.

4If x is vector-valued, this is generalized to be w(i) = exp(−(x(i) − x)T (x(i) − x)/(2τ 2)),

or w(i) = exp(−(x(i) − x)T Σ−1(x(i) − x)/(2τ 2)), for an appropriate choice of τ or Σ.

Chapter 2

Classiﬁcation and logistic
regression

Let’s now talk about the classiﬁcation problem. This is just like the regression
problem, except that the values y we now want to predict take on only
a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the binary
classiﬁcation problem in which y can take on only two values, 0 and 1.
(Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.)
For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classiﬁer for email, then x(i)
may be some features of a piece of email, and y may be 1 if it is a piece
of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. 0 is also called the negative class, and 1
the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-”
and “+.” Given x(i), the corresponding y(i) is also called the label for the
training example.

2.1 Logistic regression

We could approach the classiﬁcation problem ignoring the fact that y is
discrete-valued, and use our old linear regression algorithm to try to predict
y given x. However, it is easy to construct examples where this method
performs very poorly. Intuitively, it also doesn’t make sense for hθ(x) to take
values larger than 1 or smaller than 0 when we know that y ∈ {0, 1}.

To ﬁx this, let’s change the form for our hypotheses hθ(x). We will choose

where

hθ(x) = g(θT x) =

1
1 + e−θT x

,

g(z) =

1
1 + e−z

20

is called the logistic function or the sigmoid function. Here is a plot
showing g(z):

21

Notice that g(z) tends towards 1 as z → ∞, and g(z) tends towards 0 as
z → −∞. Moreover, g(z), and hence also h(x), is always bounded between
0 and 1. As before, we are keeping the convention of letting x0 = 1, so that
θT x = θ0 + (cid:80)d

j=1 θjxj.

For now, let’s take the choice of g as given. Other functions that smoothly
increase from 0 to 1 can also be used, but for a couple of reasons that we’ll see
later (when we talk about GLMs, and when we talk about generative learning
algorithms), the choice of the logistic function is a fairly natural one. Before
moving on, here’s a useful property of the derivative of the sigmoid function,
which we write as g(cid:48):

g(cid:48)(z) =

So, given the logistic regression model, how do we ﬁt θ for it? Following
how we saw least squares regression could be derived as the maximum like-
lihood estimator under a set of assumptions, let’s endow our classiﬁcation
model with a set of probabilistic assumptions, and then ﬁt the parameters
via maximum likelihood.

Let us assume that

P (y = 1 | x; θ) = hθ(x)
P (y = 0 | x; θ) = 1 − hθ(x)

Note that this can be written more compactly as

p(y | x; θ) = (hθ(x))y (1 − hθ(x))1−y

Assuming that the n training examples were generated independently, we
can then write down the likelihood of the parameters as

L(θ) = p((cid:126)y | X; θ)

As before, it will be easier to maximize the log likelihood:

(cid:96)(θ) = log L(θ) =

n
(cid:88)

i=1

y(i) log h(x(i)) + (1 − y(i)) log(1 − h(x(i)))

(2.1)

How do we maximize the likelihood? Similar to our derivation in the case
of linear regression, we can use gradient ascent. Written in vectorial notation,
our updates will therefore be given by θ := θ + α∇θ(cid:96)(θ). (Note the positive
rather than negative sign in the update formula, since we’re maximizing,
rather than minimizing, a function now.) Let’s start by working with just
one training example (x, y), and take derivatives to derive the stochastic
gradient ascent rule:

∂
∂θj

(cid:96)(θ) =

= (y − hθ(x)) xj

∂
∂θj

θT x

(2.2)

23

Above, we used the fact that g(cid:48)(z) = g(z)(1 − g(z)). This therefore gives us
the stochastic gradient ascent rule

θj := θj + α (cid:0)y(i) − hθ(x(i))(cid:1) x(i)

j

If we compare this to the LMS update rule, we see that it looks identical; but
this is not the same algorithm, because hθ(x(i)) is now deﬁned as a non-linear
function of θT x(i). Nonetheless, it’s a little surprising that we end up with
the same update rule for a rather diﬀerent algorithm and learning problem.
Is this coincidence, or is there a deeper reason behind this? We’ll answer this
when we get to GLM models.

Remark 2.1.1: An alternative notational viewpoint of the same loss func-
tion is also useful, especially for Section 7.1 where we study nonlinear models.
Let (cid:96)logistic : R × {0, 1} → R≥0 be the logistic loss deﬁned as

(cid:96)logistic(t, y) (cid:44) y log(1 + exp(−t)) + (1 − y) log(1 + exp(t)) .

(2.3)

One can verify by plugging in hθ(x) = 1/(1 + e−θ(cid:62)x) that the negative log-
likelihood (the negation of (cid:96)(θ) in equation (2.1)) can be re-written as

−(cid:96)(θ) = (cid:96)logistic(θ(cid:62)x, y).

Oftentimes θ(cid:62)x or t is called the logit. Basic calculus gives us that

∂(cid:96)logistic(t, y)
∂t

= y

− exp(−t)
1 + exp(−t)

+ (1 − y)

1
1 + exp(−t)

= 1/(1 + exp(−t)) − y.

Then, using the chain rule, we have that

∂
∂θj

(cid:96)(θ) = −

∂(cid:96)logistic(t, y)
∂t

·

∂t
∂θj

= (y − 1/(1 + exp(−t))) · xj = (y − hθ(x))xj ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

which is consistent with the derivation in equation (2.2). We will see this
viewpoint can be extended nonlinear models in Section 7.1.

2.2 Digression: the perceptron learning algo-

rithm

We now digress to talk brieﬂy about an algorithm that’s of some historical
interest, and that we will also return to later when we talk about learning

24

theory. Consider modifying the logistic regression method to “force” it to
output values that are either 0 or 1 or exactly. To do so, it seems natural to
change the deﬁnition of g to be the threshold function:

g(z) =

(cid:26) 1 if z ≥ 0
0 if z < 0

If we then let hθ(x) = g(θT x) as before but using this modiﬁed deﬁnition of
g, and if we use the update rule

θj := θj + α (cid:0)y(i) − hθ(x(i))(cid:1) x(i)
j .

then we have the perceptron learning algorithn.

In the 1960s, this “perceptron” was argued to be a rough model for how
individual neurons in the brain work. Given how simple the algorithm is, it
will also provide a starting point for our analysis when we talk about learning
theory later in this class. Note however that even though the perceptron may
be cosmetically similar to the other algorithms we talked about, it is actually
a very diﬀerent type of algorithm than logistic regression and least squares
linear regression; in particular, it is diﬃcult to endow the perceptron’s predic-
tions with meaningful probabilistic interpretations, or derive the perceptron
as a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm.

2.3 Multi-class classiﬁcation

Consider a classiﬁcation problem in which the response variable y can take on
any one of k values, so y ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. For example, rather than classifying
emails into the two classes spam or not-spam—which would have been a
binary classiﬁcation problem—we might want to classify them into three
classes, such as spam, personal mails, and work-related mails. The label /
response variable is still discrete, but can now take on more than two values.
We will thus model it as distributed according to a multinomial distribution.
In this case, p(y | x; θ) is a distribution over k possible discrete outcomes
and is thus a multinomial distribution. Recall that a multinomial distribu-
tion involves k numbers φ1, . . . , φk specifying the probability of each of the
outcomes. Note that these numbers must satisfy (cid:80)k
i=1 φi = 1. We will de-
sign a parameterized model that outputs φ1, . . . , φk satisfying this constraint
given the input x.

We introduce k groups of parameters θ1, . . . , θk, each of them being a
k x to represent

Intuitively, we would like to use θ(cid:62)

1 x, . . . , θ(cid:62)

vector in Rd.

25

φ1, . . . , φk, the probabilities P (y = 1 | x; θ), . . . , P (y = k | x; θ). However,
there are two issues with such a direct approach. First, θ(cid:62)
j x is not neces-
sarily within [0, 1]. Second, the summation of θ(cid:62)
j x’s is not necessarily 1.
1 x, · · · , θ(cid:62)
Thus, instead, we will use the softmax function to turn (θ(cid:62)
k x) into
a probability vector with nonnegative entries that sum up to 1.
