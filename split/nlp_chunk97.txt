development of a number of schol-
ars, including Hobbs (1979) idea that coherence relations play an inferential role for
the hearer, and the investigations by Mann and Thompson (1987) of the discourse
structure of large texts. Other approaches to coherence relations and their extrac-
tion include Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher and Las-
carides 2003, Baldridge et al. 2007) and the Linguistic Discourse Model (Polanyi
1988, Scha and Polanyi 1988, Polanyi et al. 2004). Wolf and Gibson (2005) argue
that coherence structure includes crossed bracketings, which make it impossible to
represent as a tree, and propose a graph representation instead. A compendium of
over 350 relations that have been proposed in the literature can be found in Hovy
(1990).

RST parsing was ﬁrst proposed by Marcu (1997), and early work was rule-based,
focused on discourse markers (Marcu, 2000a). The creation of the RST Discourse
TreeBank (Carlson et al. 2001, Carlson and Marcu 2001) enabled a wide variety
of machine learning algorithms, beginning with the shift-reduce parser of Marcu
(1999) that used decision trees to choose actions, and continuing with a wide variety
of machine learned parsing methods (Soricut and Marcu 2003, Sagae 2009, Hernault
et al. 2010, Feng and Hirst 2014, Surdeanu et al. 2015, Joty et al. 2015) and chunkers
(Sporleder and Lapata, 2005). Subba and Di Eugenio (2009) integrated sophisticated
semantic information into RST parsing. Ji and Eisenstein (2014) ﬁrst applied neural
models to RST parsing neural models, leading to the modern set of neural RST
models (Li et al. 2014, Li et al. 2016b, Braud et al. 2017, Yu et al. 2018, inter alia)
as well as neural segmenters (Wang et al. 2018b). and neural PDTB parsing models
(Ji and Eisenstein 2015, Qin et al. 2016, Qin et al. 2017).

Barzilay and Lapata (2005) pioneered the idea of self-supervision for coher-
ence: training a coherence model to distinguish true orderings of sentences from
random permutations. Li et al. (2014) ﬁrst applied this paradigm to neural sentence-
representation, and many neural self-supervised models followed (Li and Jurafsky
2017, Logeswaran et al. 2018, Lai and Tetreault 2018, Xu et al. 2019, Iter et al.
2020)

Another aspect of global coherence is the global topic structure of a text, the way
the topics shift over the course of the document. Barzilay and Lee (2004) introduced
an HMM model for capturing topics for coherence, and later work expanded this
intuition (Soricut and Marcu 2006, Elsner et al. 2007, Louis and Nenkova 2012, Li
and Jurafsky 2017).

The relationship between explicit and implicit discourse connectives has been
a fruitful one for research. Marcu and Echihabi (2002) ﬁrst proposed to use sen-
tences with explicit relations to help provide training data for implicit relations, by
removing the explicit relations and trying to re-predict them as a way of improv-
ing performance on implicit connectives; this idea was reﬁned by Sporleder and
Lascarides (2005), (Pitler et al., 2009), and Rutherford and Xue (2015). This rela-

tionship can also be used as a way to create discourse-aware representations. The
DisSent algorithm (Nie et al., 2019) creates the task of predicting explicit discourse
markers between two sentences. They show that representations learned to be good
at this task also function as powerful sentence representations for other discourse
tasks.

The idea of entity-based coherence seems to have arisen in multiple ﬁelds in the
mid-1970s, in functional linguistics (Chafe, 1976), in the psychology of discourse
processing (Kintsch and Van Dijk, 1978), and in the roughly contemporaneous work
of Grosz, Sidner, Joshi, and their colleagues. Grosz (1977a) addressed the focus
of attention that conversational participants maintain as the discourse unfolds. She
deﬁned two levels of focus; entities relevant to the entire discourse were said to
be in global focus, whereas entities that are locally in focus (i.e., most central to
a particular utterance) were said to be in immediate focus. Sidner 1979; 1983 de-
scribed a method for tracking (immediate) discourse foci and their use in resolving
pronouns and demonstrative noun phrases. She made a distinction between the cur-
rent discourse focus and potential foci, which are the predecessors to the backward-
and forward-looking centers of Centering theory, respectively. The name and further
roots of the centering approach lie in papers by Joshi and Kuhn (1979) and Joshi and
Weinstein (1981), who addressed the relationship between immediate focus and the
inferences required to integrate the current utterance into the discourse model. Grosz
et al. (1983) integrated this work with the prior work of Sidner and Grosz. This led
to a manuscript on centering which, while widely circulated since 1986, remained
unpublished until Grosz et al. (1995). A collection of centering papers appears in
Walker et al. (1998b). See Karamanis et al. (2004) and Poesio et al. (2004) for a
deeper exploration of centering and its parameterizations, and the History section of
Chapter 26 for more on the use of centering on coreference.

The grid model of entity-based coherence was ﬁrst proposed by Barzilay and
Lapata (2005) drawing on earlier work by Lapata (2003) and Barzilay, and then
extended by them Barzilay and Lapata (2008) and others with additional features
(Elsner and Charniak 2008, 2011, Feng et al. 2014, Lin et al. 2011) a model that
projects entities into a global graph for the discourse (Guinaudeau and Strube 2013,
Mesgar and Strube 2016), and a convolutional model to capture longer-range entity
dependencies (Nguyen and Joty, 2017).

Theories of discourse coherence have also been used in algorithms for interpret-
ing discourse-level linguistic phenomena, including verb phrase ellipsis and gap-
ping (Asher 1993, Kehler 1993), and tense interpretation (Lascarides and Asher
1993, Kehler 1994, Kehler 2000). An extensive investigation into the relationship
between coherence relations and discourse connectives can be found in Knott and
Dale (1994).

Useful surveys of discourse processing and structure include Stede (2011) and

Webber et al. (2012).

Andy Kehler wrote the Discourse chapter for the 2000 ﬁrst edition of this text-
book, which we used as the starting point for the second-edition chapter, and there
are some remnants of Andy’s lovely prose still in this third-edition coherence chap-
ter.
