. Construct and visualize two bounding boxes with an IoU of 0.5. How do they overlap with each other?
1. Modify the variable `anchors` in :numref:`subsec_labeling-anchor-boxes` and :numref:`subsec_predicting-bounding-boxes-nms`. How do the results change?
1. Non-maximum suppression is a greedy algorithm that suppresses predicted bounding boxes by *removing* them. Is it possible that some of these removed ones are actually useful? How can this algorithm be modified to suppress *softly*? You may refer to Soft-NMS :cite:`Bodla.Singh.Chellappa.ea.2017`.
1. Rather than being hand-crafted, can non-maximum suppression be learned?
