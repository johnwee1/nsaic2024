nalization
to determine

$$\begin{aligned}
P(D_1 = 1)
=& P(D_1=1, H=0) + P(D_1=1, H=1)  \\
=& P(D_1=1 \mid H=0) P(H=0) + P(D_1=1 \mid H=1) P(H=1) \\
=& 0.011485.
\end{aligned}
$$

This leads us to

$$P(H = 1 \mid D_1 = 1) = \frac{P(D_1=1 \mid H=1) P(H=1)}{P(D_1=1)} = 0.1306.$$

In other words, there is only a 13.06% chance
that the patient actually has HIV,
despite the test being pretty accurate.
As we can see, probability can be counterintuitive.
What should a patient do upon receiving such terrifying news?
Likely, the patient would ask the physician
to administer another test to get clarity.
The second test has different characteristics
and it is not as good as the first one.

| Conditional probability | $H=1$ | $H=0$ |
|:------------------------|------:|------:|
| $P(D_2 = 1 \mid H)$          |  0.98 |  0.03 |
| $P(D_2 = 0 \mid H)$          |  0.02 |  0.97 |

Unfortunately, the second test comes back positive, too.
Let's calculate the requisite probabilities to invoke Bayes' theorem
by assuming conditional independence:

$$\begin{aligned}
P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 \mid H = 0)
& = P(D_1 = 1 \mid H = 0) P(D_2 = 1 \mid H = 0)
=& 0.0003, \\
P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 \mid H = 1)
& = P(D_1 = 1 \mid H = 1) P(D_2 = 1 \mid H = 1)
=& 0.98.
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we can apply marginalization to obtain the probability
that both tests come back positive:

$$\begin{aligned}
&P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1)\\
&= P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1, H = 0) + P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1, H = 1)  \\
&= P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 \mid H = 0)P(H=0) + P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 \mid H = 1)P(H=1)\\
&= 0.00176955.
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the probability of the patient having HIV given that both tests are positive is

$$P(H = 1 \mid D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1)
= \frac{P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1 \mid H=1) P(H=1)}{P(D_1 = 1, D_2 = 1)}
= 0.8307.$$

That is, the second test allowed us to gain much higher confidence that not all is well.
Despite the second test being considerably less accurate than the first one,
it still significantly improved our estimate.
The assumption of both tests being conditionally independent of each other
was crucial for our ability to generate a more accurate estimate.
Take the extreme case where we run the same test twice.
In this situation we would expect the same outcome both times,
hence no additional insight is gained from running the same test again.
The astute reader might have noticed that the diagnosis behaved
like a classifier hiding in plain sight
where our ability to decide whether a patient is healthy
increases as we obtain more features (test outcomes).


## Expectations

Often, making decisions requires not just looking
at the probabilities assigned to individual events
but composing them together into useful aggregates
that can provide us with guidance.
For example, when random variables take continuous scalar values,
we often care about knowing what value to expect *on average*.
This quantity is formally called an *expectation*.
If we are making investments,
the first quantity of interest
might be the return we can expect,
averaging over all the possible outcomes
(and weighting by the appropriate probabilities).
For instance, say that with 50% probability,
an investment might fail altogether,
with 40% probability it might provide a 2$\times$ return,
and with 10% probability it might provide a 10$\times$ return 10$\times$.
To calculate the expected return,
we sum over all returns, multiplying each
by the probability that they will occur.
This yields the expectation
$0.5 \cdot 0 + 0.4 \cdot 2 + 0.1 \cdot 10 = 1.8$.
Hence the expected return is 1.8$\times$.


In general, the *expectation* (or average)
of the random variable $X$ is defined as

$$E[X] = E_{x \sim P}[x] = \sum_{x} x P(X = x).$$

Likewise, for densities we obtain $E[X] = \int x \;dp(x)$.
Sometimes we are interested in the expected value
of some function of $x$.
We can calculate these expectations as

$$E_{x \sim P}[f(x)] = \sum_x f(x) P(x) \textrm{ and } E_{x \sim P}[f(x)] = \int f(x) p(x) \;dx$$

for discrete probabilities and densities, respectively.
Returning to the investment example from above,
$f$ might be the *utility* (happiness)
associated with the return.
Behavior economists have long noted
that people associate greater disutility
with losing money than the utility gained
from earning one dollar relative to their baseline.
Moreover, the value of money tends to be sub-linear.
Possessing 100k dollars versus zero dollars
can make the difference between paying the rent,
eating well, and enjoying quality healthcare
versus suffering through homelessness.
On the other hand, the gains due to possessing
200k versus 100k are less dramatic.
Reasoning like this motivates the cliché
that "the utility of money is logarithmic".


If  the utility associated with a total loss were $-1$,
and the utilities associated with returns of $1$, $2$, and $10$
were $1$, $2$ and $4$, respectively,
then the expected happiness of investing
would be $0.5 \cdot (-1) + 0.4 \cdot 2 + 0.1 \cdot 4 = 0.7$
(an expected loss of utility of 30%).
If indeed this were your utility function,
you might be best off keeping the money in the bank.

For financial decisions,
we might also want to measure
how *risky* an investment is.
Here, we care not just about the expected value
but how much the actual values tend to *vary*
relative to this value.
Note that we cannot just take
the expectation of the difference
between the actual and expected values.
This is because the expectation of a difference
is the difference of the expectations,
i.e., $E[X - E[X]] = E[X] - E[E[X]] = 0$.
However, we can look at the expectation
of any non-negative function of this difference.
The *variance* of a random variable is calculated by looking
at the expected value of the *squared* differences:

$$\textrm{Var}[X] = E\left[(X - E[X])^2\right] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.$$

Here the equality follows by expanding
$(X - E[X])^2 = X^2 - 2 X E[X] + E[X]^2$
and taking expectations for each term.
The square root of the variance is another
useful quantity called the *standard deviation*.
While this and the variance
convey the same information (either can be calculated from the other),
the standard deviation has the nice property
that it is expressed in the same units
as the original quantity represented
by the random variable.

Lastly, the variance of a function
of a random variable
is defined analogously as

$$\textrm{Var}_{x \sim P}[f(x)] = E_{x \sim P}[f^2(x)] - E_{x \sim P}[f(x)]^2.$$

Returning to our investment example,
we can now compute the variance of the investment.
It is given by $0.5 \cdot 0 + 0.4 \cdot 2^2 + 0.1 \cdot 10^2 - 1.8^2 = 8.36$.
For all intents and purposes this is a risky investment.
Note that by mathematical convention mean and variance
are often referenced as $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.
This is particularly the case whenever we use it
to parametrize a Gaussian distribution.

In the same way as we introduced expectations
and variance for *scalar* random variables,
we can do so for vector-valued ones.
Expectations are easy, since we can apply them elementwise.
For instance, $\boldsymbol{\mu} \stackrel{\textrm{def}}{=} E_{\mathbf{x} \sim P}[\mathbf{x}]$
has coordinates $\mu_i = E_{\mathbf{x} \sim P}[x_i]$.
*Covariances* are more complicated.
We define them by taking expectations of the *outer product*
of the difference between random variables and their mean:

$$\boldsymbol{\Sigma} \stackrel{\textrm{def}}{=} \textrm{Cov}_{\mathbf{x} \sim P}[\mathbf{x}] = E_{\mathbf{x} \sim P}\left[(\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\top\right].$$

This matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is referred to as the covariance matrix.
An easy way to see its effect is to consider some vector $\mathbf{v}$
of the same size as $\mathbf{x}$.
It follows that

$$\mathbf{v}^\top \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{v} = E_{\mathbf{x} \sim P}\left[\mathbf{v}^\top(\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\top \mathbf{v}\right] = \textrm{Var}_{x \sim P}[\mathbf{v}^\top \mathbf{x}].$$

As such, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ allows us to compute the variance
for any linear function of $\mathbf{x}$
by a simple matrix multiplication.
The off-diagonal elements tell us how correlated the coordinates are:
a value of 0 means no correlation,
where a larger positive value
means that they are more strongly correlated.



## Discussion

In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!
We can be uncertain about the value of a label given an input.
We can be uncertain about the estimated value of a parameter.
We can even be uncertain about whether data arriving at deployment
is even from the same distribution as the training data.

By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we mean uncertainty
that is intrinsic to the problem,
and due to genuine randomness
unaccounted for by the observed variables.
By *epistemic uncertainty*, we mean uncertainty
over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty
that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.
We might have epistemic uncertainty
concerning the probability
that a coin turns up heads,
but even once we know this probability,
we are left with aleatoric uncertainty
about the outcome of any future toss.
No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin,
we will never be more or less than 50% certain
that the next toss will come up heads.
These terms come from mechanical modeling,
(see e.g., :citet:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).
It is worth noting, however, that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.
The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*
and thus, in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.


We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution
can provide us with information that can be used to estimate
the parameters of the data generating distribution.
That said, the rate at which this is possible can be quite slow.
In our coin tossing example (and many others)
we can do no better than to design estimators
that converge at a rate of $1/\sqrt{n}$,
where $n$ is the sample size (e.g., the number of tosses).
This means that by going from 10 to 1000 observations (usually a very achievable task)
we see a tenfold reduction of uncertainty,
whereas the next 1000 observations help comparatively little,
offering only a 1.41 times reduction.
This is a persistent feature of machine learning:
while there are often easy gains, it takes a very large amount of data,
and often with it an enormous amount of computation, to make further gains.
For an empirical review of this fact for large scale language models see :citet:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`.

We also sharpened our language and tools for statistical modeling.
In the process of that we learned about conditional probabilities
and about one of the most important equations in statistics---Bayes' theorem.
It is an effective tool for decoupling information conveyed by data
through a likelihood term $P(B \mid A)$ that addresses
how well observations $B$ match a choice of parameters $A$,
and a prior probability $P(A)$ which governs how plausible
a particular choice of $A$ was in the first place.
In particular, we saw how this rule can be applied
to assign probabilities to diagnoses,
based on the efficacy of the test *and*
the prevalence of the disease itself (i.e., our prior).

Lastly, we introduced a first set of nontrivial questions
about the effect of a specific probability distribution,
namely expectations and variances.
While there are many more than just linear and quadratic
expectations for a probability distribution,
these two already provide a good deal of knowledge
about the possible behavior of the distribution.
For instance, [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality)
states that $P(|X - \mu| \geq k \sigma) \leq 1/k^2$,
where $\mu$ is the expectation, $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution,
and $k > 1$ is a confidence parameter of our choosing.
It tells us that draws from a distribution lie
with at least 50% probability
within a $[-\sqrt{2} \sigma, \sqrt{2} \sigma]$
interval centered on the expectation.
