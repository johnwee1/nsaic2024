# Single Variable Calculus
:label:`sec_single_variable_calculus`

In :numref:`sec_calculus`, we saw the basic elements of differential calculus.  This section takes a deeper dive into the fundamentals of calculus and how we can understand and apply it in the context of machine learning.

## Differential Calculus
Differential calculus is fundamentally the study of how functions behave under small changes.  To see why this is so core to deep learning, let's consider an example.

Suppose that we have a deep neural network where the weights are, for convenience, concatenated into a single vector $\mathbf{w} = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)$.  Given a training dataset, we consider the loss of our neural network on this dataset, which we will write as $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w})$.

This function is extraordinarily complex, encoding the performance of all possible models of the given architecture on this dataset, so it is nearly impossible to tell what set of weights $\mathbf{w}$ will minimize the loss. Thus, in practice, we often start by initializing our weights *randomly*, and then iteratively take small steps in the direction which makes the loss decrease as rapidly as possible.

The question then becomes something that on the surface is no easier: how do we find the direction which makes the weights decrease as quickly as possible?  To dig into this, let's first examine the case with only a single weight: $L(\mathbf{w}) = L(x)$ for a single real value $x$.

Let's take $x$ and try to understand what happens when we change it by a small amount to $x + \epsilon$. If you wish to be concrete, think a number like $\epsilon = 0.0000001$.  To help us visualize what happens, let's graph an example function, $f(x) = \sin(x^x)$, over the $[0, 3]$.

```{.python .input}
#@tab mxnet
%matplotlib inline
from d2l import mxnet as d2l
from IPython import display
from mxnet import np, npx
npx.set_np()

# Plot a function in a normal range
x_big = np.arange(0.01, 3.01, 0.01)
ys = np.sin(x_big**x_big)
d2l.plot(x_big, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
%matplotlib inline
from d2l import torch as d2l
from IPython import display
import torch
torch.pi = torch.acos(torch.zeros(1)).item() * 2  # Define pi in torch

# Plot a function in a normal range
x_big = torch.arange(0.01, 3.01, 0.01)
ys = torch.sin(x_big**x_big)
d2l.plot(x_big, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab tensorflow
%matplotlib inline
from d2l import tensorflow as d2l
from IPython import display
import tensorflow as tf
tf.pi = tf.acos(tf.zeros(1)).numpy() * 2  # Define pi in TensorFlow

# Plot a function in a normal range
x_big = tf.range(0.01, 3.01, 0.01)
ys = tf.sin(x_big**x_big)
d2l.plot(x_big, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

At this large scale, the function's behavior is not simple. However, if we reduce our range to something smaller like $[1.75,2.25]$, we see that the graph becomes much simpler.

```{.python .input}
#@tab mxnet
# Plot a the same function in a tiny range
x_med = np.arange(1.75, 2.25, 0.001)
ys = np.sin(x_med**x_med)
d2l.plot(x_med, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
# Plot a the same function in a tiny range
x_med = torch.arange(1.75, 2.25, 0.001)
ys = torch.sin(x_med**x_med)
d2l.plot(x_med, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab tensorflow
# Plot a the same function in a tiny range
x_med = tf.range(1.75, 2.25, 0.001)
ys = tf.sin(x_med**x_med)
d2l.plot(x_med, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

Taking this to an extreme, if we zoom into a tiny segment, the behavior becomes far simpler: it is just a straight line.

```{.python .input}
#@tab mxnet
# Plot a the same function in a tiny range
x_small = np.arange(2.0, 2.01, 0.0001)
ys = np.sin(x_small**x_small)
d2l.plot(x_small, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
# Plot a the same function in a tiny range
x_small = torch.arange(2.0, 2.01, 0.0001)
ys = torch.sin(x_small**x_small)
d2l.plot(x_small, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab tensorflow
# Plot a the same function in a tiny range
x_small = tf.range(2.0, 2.01, 0.0001)
ys = tf.sin(x_small**x_small)
d2l.plot(x_small, ys, 'x', 'f(x)')
```

This is the key observation of single variable calculus: the behavior of familiar functions can be modeled by a line in a small enough range.  This means that for most functions, it is reasonable to expect that as we shift the $x$ value of the function by a little bit, the output $f(x)$ will also be shifted by a little bit.  The only question we need to answer is, "How large is the change in the output compared to the change in the input?  Is it half as large?  Twice as large?"

Thus, we can consider the ratio of the change in the output of a function for a small change in the input of the function.  We can write this formally as

$$
\frac{L(x+\epsilon) - L(x)}{(x+\epsilon) - x} = \frac{L(x+\epsilon) - L(x)}{\epsilon}.
$$

This is already enough to start to play around with in code.  For instance, suppose that we know that $L(x) = x^{2} + 1701(x-4)^3$, then we can see how large this value is at the point $x = 4$ as follows.

```{.python .input}
#@tab all
# Define our function
def L(x):
    return x**2 + 1701*(x-4)**3

# Print the difference divided by epsilon for several epsilon
for epsilon in [0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001]:
    print(f'epsilon = {epsilon:.5f} -> {(L(4+epsilon) - L(4)) / epsilon:.5f}')
```

Now, if we are observant, we will notice that the output of this number is suspiciously close to $8$.  Indeed, if we decrease $\epsilon$, we will see value becomes progressively closer to $8$.  Thus we may conclude, correctly, that the value we seek (the degree a change in the input changes the output) should be $8$ at the point $x=4$.  The way that a mathematician encodes this fact is

$$
\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\frac{L(4+\epsilon) - L(4)}{\epsilon} = 8.
$$

As a bit of a historical digression: in the first few decades of neural network research, scientists used this algorithm (the *method of finite differences*) to evaluate how a loss function changed under small perturbation: just change the weights and see how the loss changed.  This is computationally inefficient, requiring two evaluations of the loss function to see how a single change of one variable influenced the loss.  If we tried to do this with even a paltry few thousand parameters, it would require several thousand evaluations of the network over the entire dataset!  It was not solved until 1986 that the *backpropagation algorithm* introduced in :citet:`Rumelhart.Hinton.Williams.ea.1988` provided a way to calculate how *any* change of the weights together would change the loss in the same computation time as a single prediction of the network over the dataset.

Back in our example, this value $8$ is different for different values of $x$, so it makes sense to define it as a function of $x$.  More formally, this value dependent rate of change is referred to as the *derivative* which is written as

$$\frac{df}{dx}(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon}.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_der_def`

Different texts will use different notations for the derivative. For instance, all of the below notations indicate the same thing:

$$
\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}f = f' = \nabla_xf = D_xf = f_x.
$$

Most authors will pick a single notation and stick with it, however even that is not guaranteed.  It is best to be familiar with all of these.  We will use the notation $\frac{df}{dx}$ throughout this text, unless we want to take the derivative of a complex expression, in which case we will use $\frac{d}{dx}f$ to write expressions like
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^4+\cos\left(\frac{x^2+1}{2x-1}\right)\right].
$$

Oftentimes, it is intuitively useful to unravel the definition of derivative :eqref:`eq_der_def` again to see how a function changes when we make a small change of $x$:

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{df}{dx}(x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon} & \implies \frac{df}{dx}(x) \approx \frac{f(x+\epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon} \\ & \implies \epsilon \frac{df}{dx}(x) \approx f(x+\epsilon) - f(x) \\ & \implies f(x+\epsilon) \approx f(x) + \epsilon \frac{df}{dx}(x). \end{aligned}$$
:eqlabel:`eq_small_change`

The last equation is worth explicitly calling out.  It tells us that if you take any function and change the input by a small amount, the output would change by that small amount scaled by the derivative.

In this way, we can understand the derivative as the scaling factor that tells us how large of change we get in the output from a change in the input.

## Rules of Calculus
:label:`sec_derivative_table`

We now turn to the task of understanding how to compute the derivative of an explicit function.  A full formal treatment of calculus would derive everything from first principles.  We will not indulge in this temptation here, but rather provide an understanding of the common rules encountered.

### Common Derivatives
As was seen in :numref:`sec_calculus`, when computing derivatives one can oftentimes use a series of rules to reduce the computation to a few core functions.  We repeat them here for ease of reference.

* **Derivative of constants.** $\frac{d}{dx}c = 0$.
* **Derivative of linear functions.** $\frac{d}{dx}(ax) = a$.
* **Power rule.** $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$.
* **Derivative of exponentials.** $\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$.
* **Derivative of the logarithm.** $\frac{d}{dx}\log(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.

### Derivative Rules
If every derivative needed to be separately computed and stored in a table, differential calculus would be near impossible.  It is a gift of mathematics that we can generalize the above derivatives and compute more complex derivatives like finding the derivative of $f(x) = \log\left(1+(x-1)^{10}\right)$.  As was mentioned in :numref:`sec_calculus`, the key to doing so is to codify what happens when we take functions and combine them in various ways, most importantly: sums, products, and compositions.

* **Sum rule.** $\frac{d}{dx}\left(g(x) + h(x)\right) = \frac{dg}{dx}(x) + \frac{dh}{dx}(x)$.
* **Product rule.** $\frac{d}{dx}\left(g(x)\cdot h(x)\right) = g(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x) + \frac{dg}{dx}(x)h(x)$.
* **Chain rule.** $\frac{d}{dx}g(h(x)) = \frac{dg}{dh}(h(x))\cdot \frac{dh}{dx}(x)$.

Let's see how we may use :eqref:`eq_small_change` to understand these rules.  For the sum rule, consider following chain of reasoning:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+\epsilon) & = g(x+\epsilon) + h(x+\epsilon) \\
& \approx g(x) + \epsilon \frac{dg}{dx}(x) + h(x) + \epsilon \frac{dh}{dx}(x) \\
& = g(x) + h(x) + \epsilon\left(\frac{dg}{dx}(x) + \frac{dh}{dx}(x)\right) \\
& = f(x) + \epsilon\left(\frac{dg}{dx}(x) + \frac{dh}{dx}(x)\right).
\end{aligned}
$$

By comparing this result with the fact that $f(x+\epsilon) \approx f(x) + \epsilon \frac{df}{dx}(x)$, we see that $\frac{df}{dx}(x) = \frac{dg}{dx}(x) + \frac{dh}{dx}(x)$ as desired.  The intuition here is: when we change the input $x$, $g$ and $h$ jointly contribute to the change of the output by $\frac{dg}{dx}(x)$ and $\frac{dh}{dx}(x)$.


The product is more subtle, and will require a new observation about how to work with these expressions.  We will begin as before using :eqref:`eq_small_change`:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+\epsilon) & = g(x+\epsilon)\cdot h(x+\epsilon) \\
& \approx \left(g(x) + \epsilon \frac{dg}{dx}(x)\right)\cdot\left(h(x) + \epsilon \frac{dh}{dx}(x)\right) \\
& = g(x)\cdot h(x) + \epsilon\left(g(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x) + \frac{dg}{dx}(x)h(x)\right) + \epsilon^2\frac{dg}{dx}(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x) \\
& = f(x) + \epsilon\left(g(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x) + \frac{dg}{dx}(x)h(x)\right) + \epsilon^2\frac{dg}{dx}(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x). \\
\end{aligned}
$$


This resembles the computation done above, and indeed we see our answer ($\frac{df}{dx}(x) = g(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x) + \frac{dg}{dx}(x)h(x)$) sitting next to $\epsilon$, but there is the issue of that term of size $\epsilon^{2}$.  We will refer to this as a *higher-order term*, since the power of $\epsilon^2$ is higher than the power of $\epsilon^1$.  We will see in a later section that we will sometimes want to keep track of these, however for now observe that if $\epsilon = 0.0000001$, then $\epsilon^{2}= 0.0000000000001$, which is vastly smaller.  As we send $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we may safely ignore the higher order terms.  As a general convention in this appendix, we will use "$\approx$" to denote that the two terms are equal up to higher order terms.  However, if we wish to be more formal we may examine the difference quotient

$$
\frac{f(x+\epsilon) - f(x)}{\epsilon} = g(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x) + \frac{dg}{dx}(x)h(x) + \epsilon \frac{dg}{dx}(x)\frac{dh}{dx}(x),
$$

and see that as we send $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, the right hand term goes to zero as well.

Finally, with the chain rule, we can again progress as before using :eqref:`eq_small_change` and see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+\epsilon) & = g(h(x+\epsilon)) \\
& \approx g\left(h(x) + \epsilon \frac{dh}{dx}(x)\right) \\
& \approx g(h(x)) + \epsilon \frac{dh}{dx}(x) \frac{dg}{dh}(h(x))\\
& = f(x) + \epsilon \frac{dg}{dh}(h(x))\frac{dh}{dx}(x),
\end{aligned}
$$

where in the second line we view the function $g$ as having its input ($h(x)$) shifted by the tiny quantity $\epsilon \frac{dh}{dx}(x)$.

These rule provide us with a flexible set of tools to compute essentially any expression desired.  For instance,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\log\left(1+(x-1)^{10}\right)\right] & = \left(1+(x-1)^{10}\right)^{-1}\frac{d}{dx}\left[1+(x-1)^{10}\right]\\
& = \left(1+(x-1)^{10}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{dx}[1] + \frac{d}{dx}[(x-1)^{10}]\right) \\
& = \left(1+(x-1)^{10}\right)^{-1}\left(0 + 10(x-1)^9\frac{d}{dx}[x-1]\right) \\
& = 10\left(1+(x-1)^{10}\right)^{-1}(x-1)^9 \\
& = \frac{10(x-1)^9}{1+(x-1)^{10}}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Where each line has used the following rules:

1. The chain rule and derivative of logarithm.
2. The sum rule.
3. The derivative of constants, chain rule, and power rule.
4. The sum rule, derivative of linear functions, deriva
