# The Bahdanau Attention Mechanism
:label:`sec_seq2seq_attention`

When we encountered machine translation in :numref:`sec_seq2seq`,
we designed an encoder--decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence learning
based on two RNNs :cite:`Sutskever.Vinyals.Le.2014`.
Specifically, the RNN encoder transforms a variable-length sequence
into a *fixed-shape* context variable.
Then, the RNN decoder generates the output (target) sequence token by token
based on the generated tokens and the context variable.

Recall :numref:`fig_seq2seq_details` which we repeat (:numref:`fig_s2s_attention_state`) with some additional detail. Conventionally, in an RNN all relevant information about a source sequence is translated into some internal *fixed-dimensional* state representation by the encoder. It is this very state that is used by the decoder as the complete and exclusive source of information for generating the translated sequence. In other words, the sequence-to-sequence mechanism treats the intermediate state as a sufficient statistic of whatever string might have served as input.

![Sequence-to-sequence model. The state, as generated by the encoder, is the only piece of information shared between the encoder and the decoder.](../img/seq2seq-state.svg)
:label:`fig_s2s_attention_state`

While this is quite reasonable for short sequences, it is clear that it is infeasible for long ones, such as a book chapter or even just a very long sentence. After all, before too long there will simply not be enough "space" in the intermediate representation to store all that is important in the source sequence. Consequently the decoder will fail to translate long and complex sentences. One of the first to encounter this was :citet:`Graves.2013` who tried to design an RNN to generate handwritten text. Since the source text has arbitrary length they designed a differentiable attention model
to align text characters with the much longer pen trace,
where the alignment moves only in one direction. This, in turn, draws on decoding algorithms in speech recognition, e.g., hidden Markov models :cite:`rabiner1993fundamentals`.

Inspired by the idea of learning to align,
:citet:`Bahdanau.Cho.Bengio.2014` proposed a differentiable attention model
*without* the unidirectional alignment limitation.
When predicting a token,
if not all the input tokens are relevant,
the model aligns (or attends)
only to parts of the input sequence
that are deemed relevant to the current prediction. This is then used to update the current state before generating the next token. While quite innocuous in its description, this *Bahdanau attention mechanism* has arguably turned into one of the most influential ideas of the past decade in deep learning, giving rise to Transformers :cite:`Vaswani.Shazeer.Parmar.ea.2017` and many related new architectures.

## Model

We follow the notation introduced by the sequence-to-sequence architecture of :numref:`sec_seq2seq`, in particular :eqref:`eq_seq2seq_s_t`.
The key idea is that instead of keeping the state,
i.e., the context variable $\mathbf{c}$ summarizing the source sentence, as fixed, we dynamically update it, as a function of both the original text (encoder hidden states $\mathbf{h}_{t}$) and the text that was already generated (decoder hidden states $\mathbf{s}_{t'-1}$). This yields $\mathbf{c}_{t'}$, which is updated after any decoding time step $t'$. Suppose that the input sequence is of length $T$. In this case the context variable is the output of attention pooling:

$$\mathbf{c}_{t'} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha(\mathbf{s}_{t' - 1}, \mathbf{h}_{t}) \mathbf{h}_{t}.$$

We used $\mathbf{s}_{t' - 1}$ as the query, and
$\mathbf{h}_{t}$ as both the key and the value. Note that $\mathbf{c}_{t'}$ is then used to generate the state $\mathbf{s}_{t'}$ and to generate a new token: see :eqref:`eq_seq2seq_s_t`. In particular, the attention weight $\alpha$ is computed as in :eqref:`eq_attn-scoring-alpha`
using the additive attention scoring function
defined by :eqref:`eq_additive-attn`.
This RNN encoder--decoder architecture
using attention is depicted in :numref:`fig_s2s_attention_details`. Note that later this model was modified so as to include the already generated tokens in the decoder as further context (i.e., the attention sum does not stop at $T$ but rather it proceeds up to $t'-1$). For instance, see :citet:`chan2015listen` for a description of this strategy, as applied to speech recognition.

## Defining the Decoder with Attention

To implement the RNN encoder--decoder with attention,
we only need to redefine the decoder (omitting the generated symbols from the attention function simplifies the design). Let's begin with [**the base interface for decoders with attention**] by defining the quite unsurprisingly named `AttentionDecoder` class.

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch, mxnet, tensorflow
class AttentionDecoder(d2l.Decoder):  #@save
    """The base attention-based decoder interface."""
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    @property
    def attention_weights(self):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

We need to [**implement the RNN decoder**]
in the `Seq2SeqAttentionDecoder` class.
The state of the decoder is initialized with
(i) the hidden states of the last layer of the encoder at all time steps, used as keys and values for attention;
(ii) the hidden state of the encoder at all layers at the final time step, which serves to initialize the hidden state of the decoder;
and (iii) the valid length of the encoder, to exclude the padding tokens in attention pooling.
At each decoding time step, the hidden state of the final layer of the decoder, obtained at the previous time step, is used as the query of the attention mechanism.
Both the output of the attention mechanism and the input embedding are concatenated to serve as the input of the RNN decoder.
