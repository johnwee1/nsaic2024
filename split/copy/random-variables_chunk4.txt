lity of observing the random variable to be less than a given threshold.  It can provide a useful alternate viewpoint which unifies discrete and continuous variables.
* The mean is the average value of a random variable.
* The variance is the expected square of the difference between the random variable and its mean.
* The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.  It can be thought of as measuring the range of values the random variable may take.
* Chebyshev's inequality allows us to make this intuition rigorous by giving an explicit interval that contains the random variable most of the time.
* Joint densities allow us to work with correlated random variables.  We may marginalize joint densities by integrating over unwanted random variables to get the distribution of the desired random variable.
* The covariance and correlation coefficient provide a way to measure any linear relationship between two correlated random variables.

## Exercises
1. Suppose that we have the random variable with density given by $p(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ for $x \ge 1$ and $p(x) = 0$ otherwise.  What is $P(X > 2)$?
2. The Laplace distribution is a random variable whose density is given by $p(x = \frac{1}{2}e^{-|x|}$.  What is the mean and the standard deviation of this function?  As a hint, $\int_0^\infty xe^{-x} \; dx = 1$ and $\int_0^\infty x^2e^{-x} \; dx = 2$.
3. I walk up to you on the street and say "I have a random variable with mean $1$, standard deviation $2$, and I observed $25\%$ of my samples taking a value larger than $9$."  Do you believe me?  Why or why not?
4. Suppose that you have two random variables $X, Y$, with joint density given by $p_{XY}(x, y) = 4xy$ for $x, y \in [0,1]$ and $p_{XY}(x, y) = 0$ otherwise.  What is the covariance of $X$ and $Y$?
