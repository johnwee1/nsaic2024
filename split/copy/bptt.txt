# Backpropagation Through Time
:label:`sec_bptt`

If you completed the exercises in :numref:`sec_rnn-scratch`,
you would have seen that gradient clipping is vital 
for preventing the occasional massive gradients
from destabilizing training.
We hinted that the exploding gradients
stem from backpropagating across long sequences.
Before introducing a slew of modern RNN architectures,
let's take a closer look at how *backpropagation*
works in sequence models in mathematical detail.
Hopefully, this discussion will bring some precision 
to the notion of *vanishing* and *exploding* gradients.
If you recall our discussion of forward and backward 
propagation through computational graphs
when we introduced MLPs in :numref:`sec_backprop`,
then forward propagation in RNNs
should be relatively straightforward.
Applying backpropagation in RNNs 
is called *backpropagation through time* :cite:`Werbos.1990`.
This procedure requires us to expand (or unroll) 
the computational graph of an RNN
one time step at a time.
The unrolled RNN is essentially 
a feedforward neural network 
with the special property 
that the same parameters 
are repeated throughout the unrolled network,
appearing at each time step.
Then, just as in any feedforward neural network,
we can apply the chain rule, 
backpropagating gradients through the unrolled net.
The gradient with respect to each parameter
must be summed across all places 
that the parameter occurs in the unrolled net.
Handling such weight tying should be familiar 
from our chapters on convolutional neural networks.


Complications arise because sequences
can be rather long.
It is not unusual to work with text sequences
consisting of over a thousand tokens. 
Note that this poses problems both from 
a computational (too much memory)
and optimization (numerical instability)
standpoint. 
Input from the first step passes through
over 1000 matrix products before arriving at the output, 
and another 1000 matrix products 
are required to compute the gradient. 
We now analyze what can go wrong and 
how to address it in practice.


## Analysis of Gradients in RNNs
:label:`subsec_bptt_analysis`

We start with a simplified model of how an RNN works.
This model ignores details about the specifics 
of the hidden state and how it is updated.
The mathematical notation here
does not explicitly distinguish
scalars, vectors, and matrices.
We are just trying to develop some intuition.
In this simplified model,
we denote $h_t$ as the hidden state,
$x_t$ as input, and $o_t$ as output
at time step $t$.
Recall our discussions in
:numref:`subsec_rnn_w_hidden_states`
that the input and the hidden state
can be concatenated before being multiplied 
by one weight variable in the hidden layer.
Thus, we use $w_\textrm{h}$ and $w_\textrm{o}$ to indicate the weights 
of the hidden layer and the output layer, respectively.
As a result, the hidden states and outputs 
at each time step are

$$\begin{aligned}h_t &= f(x_t, h_{t-1}, w_\textrm{h}),\\o_t &= g(h_t, w_\textrm{o}),\end{aligned}$$
:eqlabel:`eq_bptt_ht_ot`

where $f$ and $g$ are transformations
of the hidden layer and the output layer, respectively.
Hence, we have a chain of values 
$\{\ldots, (x_{t-1}, h_{t-1}, o_{t-1}), (x_{t}, h_{t}, o_t), \ldots\}$ 
that depend on each other via recurrent computation.
The forward propagation is fairly straightforward.
All we need is to loop through the $(x_t, h_t, o_t)$ triples one time step at a time.
The discrepancy between output $o_t$ and the desired target $y_t$ 
is then evaluated by an objective function 
across all the $T$ time steps as

$$L(x_1, \ldots, x_T, y_1, \ldots, y_T, w_\textrm{h}, w_\textrm{o}) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T l(y_t, o_t).$$



For backpropagation, matters are a bit trickier, 
especially when we compute the gradients 
with regard to the parameters $w_\textrm{h}$ of the objective function $L$. 
To be specific, by the chain rule,

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}  & = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial l(y_t, o_t)}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}  \\& = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial l(y_t, o_t)}{\partial o_t} \frac{\partial g(h_t, w_\textrm{o})}{\partial h_t}  \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}.\end{aligned}$$
:eqlabel:`eq_bptt_partial_L_wh`

The first and the second factors of the
product in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_L_wh`
are easy to compute.
The third factor $\partial h_t/\partial w_\textrm{h}$ is where things get tricky, 
since we need to recurrently compute the effect of the parameter $w_\textrm{h}$ on $h_t$.
According to the recurrent computation
in :eqref:`eq_bptt_ht_ot`,
$h_t$ depends on both $h_{t-1}$ and $w_\textrm{h}$,
where computation of $h_{t-1}$
also depends on $w_\textrm{h}$.
Thus, evaluating the total derivate of $h_t$ 
with respect to $w_\textrm{h}$ using the chain rule yields

$$\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}= \frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial w_\textrm{h}} +\frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial h_{t-1}} \frac{\partial h_{t-1}}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_recur`


To derive the above gradient, assume that we have 
three sequences $\{a_{t}\},\{b_{t}\},\{c_{t}\}$ 
satisfying $a_{0}=0$ and $a_{t}=b_{t}+c_{t}a_{t-1}$ for $t=1, 2,\ldots$.
Then for $t\geq 1$, it is easy to show

$$a_{t}=b_{t}+\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}\left(\prod_{j=i+1}^{t}c_{j}\right)b_{i}.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_bptt_at`

By substituting $a_t$, $b_t$, and $c_t$ according to

$$\begin{aligned}a_t &= \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial w_\textrm{h}},\\
b_t &= \frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}, \\
c_t &= \frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial h_{t-1}},\end{aligned}$$

the gradient computation in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_recur` satisfies
$a_{t}=b_{t}+c_{t}a_{t-1}$.
Thus, per :eqref:`eq_bptt_at`, 
we can remove the recurrent computation 
in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_recur` with

$$\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}=\frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}+\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}\left(\prod_{j=i+1}^{t} \frac{\partial f(x_{j},h_{j-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial h_{j-1}} \right) \frac{\partial f(x_{i},h_{i-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`

While we can use the chain rule to compute $\partial h_t/\partial w_\textrm{h}$ recursively, 
this chain can get very long whenever $t$ is large.
Let's discuss a number of strategies for dealing with this problem.

### Full Computation ### 

One idea might be to compute the full sum in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`.
However, this is very slow and gradients can blow up,
since subtle changes in the initial conditions
can potentially affect the outcome a lot.
That is, we could see things similar to the butterfly effect,
where minimal changes in the initial conditions 
lead to disproportionate changes in the outcome.
This is generally undesirable.
After all, we are looking for robust estimators that generalize well. 
Hence this strategy is almost never used in practice.

### Truncating Time Steps###

Alternatively,
we can truncate the sum in
:eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_gen`
after $\tau$ steps. 
This is what we have been discussing so far. 
This leads to an *approximation* of the true gradient,
simply by terminating the sum at $\partial h_{t-\tau}/\partial w_\textrm{h}$. 
In practice this works quite well. 
It is what is commonly referred to as truncated 
backpropgation through time :cite:`Jaeger.2002`.
One of the consequences of this is that the model 
focuses primarily on short-term influence 
rather than long-term consequences. 
This is actually *desirable*, since it biases the estimate 
towards simpler and more stable models.


### Randomized Truncation ### 

Last, we can replace $\partial h_t/\partial w_\textrm{h}$
by a random variable which is correct in expectation 
but truncates the sequence.
This is achieved by using a sequence of $\xi_t$
with predefined $0 \leq \pi_t \leq 1$,
where $P(\xi_t = 0) = 1-\pi_t$ and 
$P(\xi_t = \pi_t^{-1}) = \pi_t$, thus $E[\xi_t] = 1$.
We use this to replace the gradient
$\partial h_t/\partial w_\textrm{h}$
in :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_ht_wh_recur`
with

$$z_t= \frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial w_\textrm{h}} +\xi_t \frac{\partial f(x_{t},h_{t-1},w_\textrm{h})}{\partial h_{t-1}} \frac{\partial h_{t-1}}{\partial w_\textrm{h}}.$$


It follows from the definition of $\xi_t$ 
that $E[z_t] = \partial h_t/\partial w_\textrm{h}$.
Whenever $\xi_t = 0$ the recurrent computation
terminates at that time step $t$.
This leads to a weighted sum of sequences of varying lengths,
where long sequences are rare but appropriately overweighted. 
This idea was proposed by 
:citet:`Tallec.Ollivier.2017`.

### Comparing Strategies

![Comparing strategies for computing gradients in RNNs. From top to bottom: randomized truncation, regular truncation, and full computation.](../img/truncated-bptt.svg)
:label:`fig_truncated_bptt`


:numref:`fig_truncated_bptt` illustrates the three strategies 
when analyzing the first few characters of *The Time Machine* 
using backpropagation through time for RNNs:

* The first row is the randomized truncation that partitions the text into segments of varying lengths.
* The second row is the regular truncation that breaks the text into subsequences of the same length. This is what we have been doing in RNN experiments.
* The third row is the full backpropagation through time that leads to a computationally infeasible expression.


Unfortunately, while appealing in theory, 
randomized truncation does not work 
much better than regular truncation, 
most likely due to a number of factors.
First, the effect of an observation
after a number of backpropagation steps 
into the past is quite sufficient 
to capture dependencies in practice. 
Second, the increased variance counteracts the fact 
that the gradient is more accurate with more steps. 
Third, we actually *want* models that have only 
a short range of interactions. 
Hence, regularly truncated backpropagation through time 
has a slight regularizing effect that can be desirable.

## Backpropagation Through Time in Detail

After discussing the general principle,
let's discuss backpropagation through time in detail.
In contrast to the analysis in :numref:`subsec_bptt_analysis`,
in the following we will show how to compute
the gradients of the objective function
with respect to all the decomposed model parameters.
To keep things simple, we consider 
an RNN without bias parameters,
whose activation function in the hidden layer
uses the identity mapping ($\phi(x)=x$).
For time step $t$, let the single example input 
and the target be $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_t$, respectively. 
The hidden state $\mathbf{h}_t \in \mathbb{R}^h$ 
and the output $\mathbf{o}_t \in \mathbb{R}^q$
are computed as

$$\begin{aligned}\mathbf{h}_t &= \mathbf{W}_\textrm{hx} \mathbf{x}_t + \mathbf{W}_\textrm{hh} \mathbf{h}_{t-1},\\
\mathbf{o}_t &= \mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh} \mathbf{h}_{t},\end{aligned}$$

where $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{hx} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$, $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{hh} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times h}$, and
$\mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh} \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times h}$
are the weight parameters.
Denote by $l(\mathbf{o}_t, y_t)$
the loss at time step $t$. 
Our objective function,
the loss over $T$ time steps
from the beginning of the sequence is thus

$$L = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T l(\mathbf{o}_t, y_t).$$


In order to visualize the dependencies among
model variables and parameters during computation
of the RNN,
we can draw a computational graph for the model,
as shown in :numref:`fig_rnn_bptt`.
For example, the computation of the hidden states of time step 3,
$\mathbf{h}_3$, depends on the model parameters
$\mathbf{W}_\textrm{hx}$ and $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{hh}$,
the hidden state of the previous time step $\mathbf{h}_2$,
and the input of the current time step $\mathbf{x}_3$.

![Computational graph showing dependencies for an RNN model with three time steps. Boxes represent variables (not shaded) or parameters (shaded) and circles represent operators.](../img/rnn-bptt.svg)
:label:`fig_rnn_bptt`

As just mentioned, the model parameters in :numref:`fig_rnn_bptt` 
are $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{hx}$, $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{hh}$, and $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh}$. 
Generally, training this model requires 
gradient computation with respect to these parameters
$\partial L/\partial \mathbf{W}_\textrm{hx}$, $\partial L/\partial \mathbf{W}_\textrm{hh}$, and $\partial L/\partial \mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh}$.
According to the dependencies in :numref:`fig_rnn_bptt`,
we can traverse in the opposite direction of the arrows
to calculate and store the gradients in turn.
To flexibly express the multiplication of 
matrices, vectors, and scalars of different shapes
in the chain rule,
we continue to use the $\textrm{prod}$ operator 
as described in :numref:`sec_backprop`.


First of all, differentiating the objective function
with respect to the model output at any time step $t$
is fairly straightforward:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{o}_t} =  \frac{\partial l (\mathbf{o}_t, y_t)}{T \cdot \partial \mathbf{o}_t} \in \mathbb{R}^q.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_bptt_partial_L_ot`

Now we can calculate the gradient of the objective 
with respect to the parameter $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh}$
in the output layer:
$\partial L/\partial \mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh} \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times h}$. 
Based on :numref:`fig_rnn_bptt`, 
the objective $L$ depends on $\mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh}$ 
via $\mathbf{o}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{o}_T$. 
Using the chain rule yields

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh}}
= \sum_{t=1}^T \textrm{prod}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{o}_t}, \frac{\partial \mathbf{o}_t}{\partial \mathbf{W}_\textrm{qh}}\right)
= \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{o}_t} \mathbf{h}_t^\top,
$$

where $\partial L/\partial \mathbf{o}_t$
is given by :eqref:`eq_bptt_partial_L_ot`.

Next, as shown in :numref:`fig_rnn_bptt`,
at the final time step $T$,
