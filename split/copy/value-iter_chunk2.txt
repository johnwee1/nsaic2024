s that we know the Markov decision process (MDP), e.g., the transition and reward functions, completely.


## Exercises

1. Try increasing the grid size to $8 \times 8$. Compared with $4 \times 4$ grid, how many iterations does it take to find the optimal value function?
1. What is the computational complexity of the Value Iteration algorithm?
1. Run the Value Iteration algorithm again with $\gamma$ (i.e. "gamma" in the above code) when it equals to $0$, $0.5$, and $1$ and analyze its results. 
1. How does the value of $\gamma$ affect the number of iterations taken by Value Iteration to converge? What happens when $\gamma=1$?
