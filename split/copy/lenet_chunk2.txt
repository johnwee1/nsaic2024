zed deep learning model development tremendously. In the next chapter, we will journey down this rabbit hole to see where it takes us.

## Exercises

1. Let's modernize LeNet. Implement and test the following changes:
    1. Replace average pooling with max-pooling.
    1. Replace the softmax layer with ReLU.
1. Try to change the size of the LeNet style network to improve its accuracy in addition to max-pooling and ReLU.
    1. Adjust the convolution window size.
    1. Adjust the number of output channels.
    1. Adjust the number of convolution layers.
    1. Adjust the number of fully connected layers.
    1. Adjust the learning rates and other training details (e.g., initialization and number of epochs).
1. Try out the improved network on the original MNIST dataset.
1. Display the activations of the first and second layer of LeNet for different inputs (e.g., sweaters and coats).
1. What happens to the activations when you feed significantly different images into the network (e.g., cats, cars, or even random noise)?
