# Generalization in Classification

:label:`chap_classification_generalization`



So far, we have focused on how to tackle multiclass classification problems
by training (linear) neural networks with multiple outputs and softmax functions.
Interpreting our model's outputs as probabilistic predictions,
we motivated and derived the cross-entropy loss function,
which calculates the negative log likelihood
that our model (for a fixed set of parameters)
assigns to the actual labels.
And finally, we put these tools into practice
by fitting our model to the training set.
However, as always, our goal is to learn *general patterns*,
as assessed empirically on previously unseen data (the test set).
High accuracy on the training set means nothing.
Whenever each of our inputs is unique
(and indeed this is true for most high-dimensional datasets),
we can attain perfect accuracy on the training set
by just memorizing the dataset on the first training epoch,
and subsequently looking up the label whenever we see a new image.
And yet, memorizing the exact labels
associated with the exact training examples
does not tell us how to classify new examples.
Absent further guidance, we might have to fall back
on random guessing whenever we encounter new examples.

A number of burning questions demand immediate attention:

1. How many test examples do we need to give a good estimate of the accuracy of our classifiers on the underlying population?
1. What happens if we keep evaluating models on the same test repeatedly?
1. Why should we expect that fitting our linear models to the training set
   should fare any better than our naive memorization scheme?


Whereas :numref:`sec_generalization_basics` introduced
the basics of overfitting and generalization
in the context of linear regression,
this chapter will go a little deeper,
introducing some of the foundational ideas
of statistical learning theory.
It turns out that we often can guarantee generalization *a priori*:
for many models,
and for any desired upper bound
on the generalization gap $\epsilon$,
we can often determine some required number of samples $n$
such that if our training set contains at least $n$
samples, our empirical error will lie
within $\epsilon$ of the true error,
*for any data generating distribution*.
Unfortunately, it also turns out
that while these sorts of guarantees provide
a profound set of intellectual building blocks,
they are of limited practical utility
to the deep learning practitioner.
In short, these guarantees suggest
that ensuring generalization
of deep neural networks *a priori*
requires an absurd number of examples
(perhaps trillions or more),
even when we find that, on the tasks we care about,
deep neural networks typically generalize
remarkably well with far fewer examples (thousands).
Thus deep learning practitioners often forgo
*a priori* guarantees altogether,
instead employing methods
that have generalized well
on similar problems in the past,
and certifying generalization *post hoc*
through empirical evaluations.
When we get to :numref:`chap_perceptrons`,
we will revisit generalization
and provide a light introduction
to the vast scientific literature
that has sprung in attempts
to explain why deep neural networks generalize in practice.

## The Test Set

Since we have already begun to rely on test sets
as the gold standard method
for assessing generalization error,
let's get started by discussing
the properties of such error estimates.
Let's focus on a fixed classifier $f$,
without worrying about how it was obtained.
Moreover suppose that we possess
a *fresh* dataset of examples $\mathcal{D} = {(\mathbf{x}^{(i)},y^{(i)})}_{i=1}^n$
that were not used to train the classifier $f$.
The *empirical error* of our classifier $f$ on $\mathcal{D}$
is simply the fraction of instances
for which the prediction $f(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$
disagrees with the true label $y^{(i)}$,
and is given by the following expression:

$$\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}(f(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \neq y^{(i)}).$$

By contrast, the *population error*
is the *expected* fraction
of examples in the underlying population
(some distribution $P(X,Y)$  characterized
by probability density function $p(\mathbf{x},y)$)
for which our classifier disagrees
with the true label:

$$\epsilon(f) =  E_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim P} \mathbf{1}(f(\mathbf{x}) \neq y) =
\int\int \mathbf{1}(f(\mathbf{x}) \neq y) p(\mathbf{x}, y) \;d\mathbf{x} dy.$$

While $\epsilon(f)$ is the quantity that we actually care about,
we cannot observe it directly,
just as we cannot directly
observe the average height in a large population
without measuring every single person.
We can only estimate this quantity based on samples.
Because our test set $\mathcal{D}$
is statistically representative
of the underlying population,
we can view $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$ as a statistical
estimator of the population error $\epsilon(f)$.
Moreover, because our quantity of interest $\epsilon(f)$
is an expectation (of the random variable $\mathbf{1}(f(X) \neq Y)$)
and the corresponding estimator $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$
is the sample average,
estimating the population error
is simply the classic problem of mean estimation,
which you may recall from :numref:`sec_prob`.

An important classical result from probability theory
called the *central limit theorem* guarantees
that whenever we possess $n$ random samples $a_1, ..., a_n$
drawn from any distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$,
then, as the number of samples $n$ approaches infinity,
the sample average $\hat{\mu}$ approximately
tends towards a normal distribution centered
at the true mean and with standard deviation $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.
Already, this tells us something important:
as the number of examples grows large,
our test error $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$
should approach the true error $\epsilon(f)$
at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$.
Thus, to estimate our test error twice as precisely,
we must collect four times as large a test set.
To reduce our test error by a factor of one hundred,
we must collect ten thousand times as large a test set.
In general, such a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$
is often the best we can hope for in statistics.

Now that we know something about the asymptotic rate
at which our test error $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$ converges to the true error $\epsilon(f)$,
we can zoom in on some important details.
Recall that the random variable of interest
$\mathbf{1}(f(X) \neq Y)$
can only take values $0$ and $1$
and thus is a Bernoulli random variable,
characterized by a parameter
indicating the probability that it takes value $1$.
Here, $1$ means that our classifier made an error,
so the parameter of our random variable
is actually the true error rate $\epsilon(f)$.
The variance $\sigma^2$ of a Bernoulli
depends on its parameter (here, $\epsilon(f)$)
according to the expression $\epsilon(f)(1-\epsilon(f))$.
While $\epsilon(f)$ is initially unknown,
we know that it cannot be greater than $1$.
A little investigation of this function
reveals that our variance is highest
when the true error rate is close to $0.5$
and can be far lower when it is
close to $0$ or close to $1$.
This tells us that the asymptotic standard deviation
of our estimate $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$ of the error $\epsilon(f)$
(over the choice of the $n$ test samples)
cannot be any greater than $\sqrt{0.25/n}$.

If we ignore the fact that this rate characterizes
behavior as the test set size approaches infinity
rather than when we possess finite samples,
this tells us that if we want our test error $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$
to approximate the population error $\epsilon(f)$
such that one standard deviation corresponds
to an interval of $\pm 0.01$,
then we should collect roughly 2500 samples.
If we want to fit two standard deviations
in that range and thus be 95% confident
that $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f) \in \epsilon(f) \pm 0.01$,
then we will need 10,000 samples!

This turns out to be the size of the test sets
for many popular benchmarks in machine learning.
You might be surprised to find out that thousands
of applied deep learning papers get published every year
making a big deal out of error rate improvements of $0.01$ or less.
Of course, when the error rates are much closer to $0$,
then an improvement of $0.01$ can indeed be a big deal.


One pesky feature of our analysis thus far
is that it really only tells us about asymptotics,
i.e., how the relationship between $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}$ and $\epsilon$
evolves as our sample size goes to infinity.
Fortunately, because our random variable is bounded,
we can obtain valid finite sample bounds
by applying an inequality due to Hoeffding (1963):

$$P(\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f) - \epsilon(f) \geq t) < \exp\left( - 2n t^2 \right).$$

Solving for the smallest dataset size
that would allow us to conclude
with 95% confidence that the distance $t$
between our estimate $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$
and the true error rate $\epsilon(f)$
does not exceed $0.01$,
you will find that roughly 15,000 examples are required
as compared to the 10,000 examples suggested
by the asymptotic analysis above.
If you go deeper into statistics
you will find that this trend holds generally.
Guarantees that hold even in finite samples
are typically slightly more conservative.
Note that in the scheme of things,
these numbers are not so far apart,
reflecting the general usefulness
of asymptotic analysis for giving
us ballpark figures even if they are not
guarantees we can take to court.

## Test Set Reuse

In some sense, you are now set up to succeed
at conducting empirical machine learning research.
Nearly all practical models are developed
and validated based on test set performance
and you are now a master of the test set.
For any fixed classifier $f$,
you know how to evaluate its test error $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f)$,
and know precisely what can (and cannot)
be said about its population error $\epsilon(f)$.

So let's say that you take this knowledge
and prepare to train your first model $f_1$.
Knowing just how confident you need to be
in the performance of your classifier's error rate
you apply our analysis above to determine
an appropriate number of examples
to set aside for the test set.
Moreover, let's assume that you took the lessons from
:numref:`sec_generalization_basics` to heart
and made sure to preserve the sanctity of the test set
by conducting all of your preliminary analysis,
hyperparameter tuning, and even selection
among multiple competing model architectures
on a validation set.
Finally you evaluate your model $f_1$
on the test set and report an unbiased
estimate of the population error
with an associated confidence interval.

So far everything seems to be going well.
However, that night you wake up at 3am
with a brilliant idea for a new modeling approach.
The next day, you code up your new model,
tune its hyperparameters on the validation set
and not only are you getting your new model $f_2$ to work
but its error rate appears to be much lower than $f_1$'s.
However, the thrill of discovery suddenly fades
as you prepare for the final evaluation.
You do not have a test set!

Even though the original test set $\mathcal{D}$
is still sitting on your server,
you now face two formidable problems.
First, when you collected your test set,
you determined the required level of precision
under the assumption that you were evaluating
a single classifier $f$.
However, if you get into the business
of evaluating multiple classifiers $f_1, ..., f_k$
on the same test set,
you must consider the problem of false discovery.
Before, you might have been 95% sure
that $\epsilon_\mathcal{D}(f) \in \epsilon(f) \pm 0.01$
for a single classifier $f$
and thus the probability of a misleading result
was a mere 5%.
With $k$ classifiers in the mix,
it can be hard to guarantee
that there is not even one among them
whose test set performance is misleading.
With 20 classifiers under consideration,
you might have no power at all
to rule out the possibility
that at least one among them
received a misleading score.
This problem relates to multiple hypothesis testing,
which despite a vast literature in statistics,
remains a persistent problem plaguing scientific research.


If that is not enough to worry you,
there is a special reason to distrust
the results that you get on subsequent evaluations.
Recall that our analysis of test set performance
rested on the assumption that the classifier
was chosen absent any contact with the test set
and thus we could view the test set
as drawn randomly from the underlying population.
Here, not only are you testing multiple functions,
the subsequent function $f_2$ was chosen
after you observed the test set performance of $f_1$.
Once information from the test set has leaked to the modeler,
it can never be a true test set again in the strictest sense.
This problem is called *adaptive overfitting* and has recently emerged
as a topic of intense interest to learning theorists and statisticians
:cite:`dwork2015preserving`.
Fortunately, while it is possible
to leak all information out of a holdout set,
and the theoretical worst case scenarios are bleak,
these analyses may be too conservative.
In practice, take care to create real test sets,
to consult them as infrequently as possible,
to account for multiple hypothesis testing
when reporting confidence intervals,
and to dial up your vigilance more aggressively
when the stakes are high and your dataset size is small.
When running a series of benchmark challenges,
it is often good practice to maintain
several test sets so that after each round,
the old test set can be demoted to a validation set.





## Statistical Learning Theory

Put simply, *test sets are all that we really have*,
and yet this fact seems strangely unsatisfying.
First, we seldom possess a *true test set*---unless
we are the ones creating the dataset,
someone else has probably already evaluated
their own classifier on our ostensible "test set".
And
