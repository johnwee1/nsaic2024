hat you are 
comparing to a human who is given the same input as the component), then the pipeline is 
flawed and should be redesigned. 

18 In the self-driving example above, in theory one could solve this problem by also feeding the raw camera 
image into the planning component. However, this would violate the design principle of “Task simplicity” 
described in Chapter 51, because the path planning module now needs to input a raw image and has a very 
complex task to solve. That’s why adding a Detect lane markings component is a better choice--it helps get the 
important and previously missing information about lane markings to the path planning module, but you avoid 
making any particular module overly complex to build/train.
