 example in the previous subsection,
we have d = 1 and p = 4.) Now our goal is to ï¬t the function Î¸T Ï†(x), with
Î¸ being a vector in Rp instead of Rd. We can replace all the occurrences of
x(i) in the algorithm above by Ï†(x(i)) to obtain the new update:

Î¸ := Î¸ + Î±

n
(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:0)y(i) âˆ’ Î¸T Ï†(x(i))(cid:1) Ï†(x(i))

Similarly, the corresponding stochastic gradient descent update rule is

Î¸ := Î¸ + Î± (cid:0)y(i) âˆ’ Î¸T Ï†(x(i))(cid:1) Ï†(x(i))

5.3 LMS with the kernel trick

The gradient descent update, or stochastic gradient update above becomes
computationally expensive when the features Ï†(x) is high-dimensional. For
example, consider the direct extension of the feature map in equation (5.1)
to high-dimensional input x: suppose x âˆˆ Rd, and let Ï†(x) be the vector that

50

(5.5)

contains all the monomials of x with degree â‰¤ 3

The dimension of the features Ï†(x) is on the order of d3.1 This is a pro-
hibitively long vector for computational purpose â€” when d = 1000, each
update requires at least computing and storing a 10003 = 109 dimensional
vector, which is 106 times slower than the update rule for for ordinary least
squares updates (5.2).

It may appear at ï¬rst that such d3 runtime per update and memory usage
are inevitable, because the vector Î¸ itself is of dimension p â‰ˆ d3, and we may
need to update every entry of Î¸ and store it. However, we will introduce the
kernel trick with which we will not need to store Î¸ explicitly, and the runtime
can be signiï¬cantly improved.

For simplicity, we assume the initialize the value Î¸ = 0, and we focus
on the iterative update (5.3). The main observation is that at any time, Î¸
can be represented as a linear combination of the vectors Ï†(x(1)), . . . , Ï†(x(n)).
Indeed, we can show this inductively as follows. At initialization, Î¸ = 0 =
(cid:80)n

i=1 0 Â· Ï†(x(i)). Assume at some point, Î¸ can be represented as

Î¸ =

n
(cid:88)

i=1

Î²iÏ†(x(i))

(5.6)

1Here, for simplicity, we include all the monomials with repetitions (so that, e.g., x1x2x3
and x2x3x1 both appear in Ï†(x)). Therefore, there are totally 1 + d + d2 + d3 entries in
Ï†(x).

51

for some Î²1, . . . , Î²n âˆˆ R. Then we claim that in the next round, Î¸ is still a
linear combination of Ï†(x(1)), . . . , Ï†(x(n)) because

Î¸ := Î¸ + Î±

Ï†(x(i))

(5.7)

You may realize that our general strategy is to implicitly represent the p-
dimensional vector Î¸ by a set of coeï¬ƒcients Î²1, . . . , Î²n. Towards doing this,
we derive the update rule of the coeï¬ƒcients Î²1, . . . , Î²n. Using the equation
above, we see that the new Î²i depends on the old one via

Î²i := Î²i + Î± (cid:0)y(i) âˆ’ Î¸T Ï†(x(i))(cid:1)

(5.8)

Here we still have the old Î¸ on the RHS of the equation. Replacing Î¸ by
Î¸ = (cid:80)n

j=1 Î²jÏ†(x(j)) gives

âˆ€i âˆˆ {1, . . . , n}, Î²i := Î²i + Î±

We often rewrite Ï†(x(j))T Ï†(x(i)) as (cid:104)Ï†(x(j)), Ï†(x(i))(cid:105) to emphasize that itâ€™s the
inner product of the two feature vectors. Viewing Î²iâ€™s as the new representa-
tion of Î¸, we have successfully translated the batch gradient descent algorithm
into an algorithm that updates the value of Î² iteratively. It may appear that
at every iteration, we still need to compute the values of (cid:104)Ï†(x(j)), Ï†(x(i))(cid:105) for
all pairs of i, j, each of which may take roughly O(p) operation. However,
two important properties come to rescue:

1. We can pre-compute the pairwise inner products (cid:104)Ï†(x(j)), Ï†(x(i))(cid:105) for all

pairs of i, j before the loop starts.

2. For the feature map Ï† deï¬ned in (5.5) (or many other interesting fea-
ture maps), computing (cid:104)Ï†(x(j)), Ï†(x(i))(cid:105) can be eï¬ƒcient and does not

necessarily require computing Ï†(x(i)) explicitly. This is because:

(5.9)

Therefore, to compute (cid:104)Ï†(x), Ï†(z)(cid:105), we can ï¬rst compute (cid:104)x, z(cid:105) with
O(d) time and then take another constant number of operations to com-
pute 1 + (cid:104)x, z(cid:105) + (cid:104)x, z(cid:105)2 + (cid:104)x, z(cid:105)3.

As you will see, the inner products between the features (cid:104)Ï†(x), Ï†(z)(cid:105) are
essential here. We deï¬ne the Kernel corresponding to the feature map Ï† as
a function that maps X Ã— X â†’ R satisfying: 2

K(x, z) (cid:44) (cid:104)Ï†(x), Ï†(z)(cid:105)

(5.10)

To wrap up the discussion, we write the down the ï¬nal algorithm as

follows:

1. Compute all the values K(x(i), x(j)) (cid:44) (cid:104)Ï†(x(i)), Ï†(x(j))(cid:105) using equa-

tion (5.9) for all i, j âˆˆ {1, . . . , n}. Set Î² := 0.

2. Loop:

âˆ€i âˆˆ {1, . . . , n}, Î²i := Î²i + Î±

y(i) âˆ’

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

Î²jK(x(i), x(j))

(5.11)

n
(cid:88)

j=1

Or in vector notation, letting K be the n Ã— n matrix with Kij =

K(x(i), x(j)), we have

Î² := Î² + Î±((cid:126)y âˆ’ KÎ²)

With the algorithm above, we can update the representation Î² of the
vector Î¸ eï¬ƒciently with O(n) time per update. Finally, we need to show that

2Recall that X is the space of the input x. In our running example, X = Rd

53

the knowledge of the representation Î² suï¬ƒces to compute the prediction
Î¸T Ï†(x). Indeed, we have

Î¸T Ï†(x) =

n

i=1

T
Î²iÏ†(x(i))

Ï†(x) =

n
(cid:88)

i=1

Î²iK(x(i), x)

(5.12)

You may realize that fundamentally all we need to know about the feature
map Ï†(Â·) is encapsulated in the corresponding kernel function K(Â·, Â·). We
will expand on this in the next section.

5.4 Properties of kernels

In the last subsection, we started with an explicitly deï¬ned feature map Ï†,
which induces the kernel function K(x, z) (cid:44) (cid:104)Ï†(x), Ï†(z)(cid:105). Then we saw that
the kernel function is so intrinsic so that as long as the kernel function is
deï¬ned, the whole training algorithm can be written entirely in the language
of the kernel without referring to the feature map Ï†, so can the prediction of
a test example x (equation (5.12).)

Therefore, it would be tempted to deï¬ne other kernel function K(Â·, Â·) and
run the algorithm (5.11). Note that the algorithm (5.11) does not need to
explicitly access the feature map Ï†, and therefore we only need to ensure the
existence of the feature map Ï†, but do not necessarily need to be able to
explicitly write Ï† down.

What kinds of functions K(Â·, Â·) can correspond to some feature map Ï†? In
other words, can we tell if there is some feature mapping Ï† so that K(x, z) =
Ï†(x)T Ï†(z) for all x, z?

If we can answer this question by giving a precise characterization of valid
kernel functions, then we can completely change the interface of selecting
feature maps Ï† to the interface of selecting kernel function K. Concretely,
we can pick a function K, verify that it satisï¬es the characterization (so
that there exists a feature map Ï† that K corresponds to), and then we can
run update rule (5.11). The beneï¬t here is that we donâ€™t have to be able
to compute Ï† or write it down analytically, and we only need to know its
existence. We will answer this question at the end of this subsection after
we go through several concrete examples of kernels.

Suppose x, z âˆˆ Rd, and letâ€™s ï¬rst consider the function K(Â·, Â·) deï¬ned as:

K(x, z) = (xT z)2.

54

We can also write this as

K(x, z) =

(cid:32) d

(cid:88)

(cid:33) (cid:32) d

Thus, we see that K(x, z) = (cid:104)Ï†(x), Ï†(z)(cid:105) is the kernel function that corre-
sponds to the the feature mapping Ï† given (shown here for the case of d = 3)

Revisiting the computational eï¬ƒciency perspective of kernel, note that whereas
calculating the high-dimensional Ï†(x) requires O(d2) time, ï¬nding K(x, z)
takes only O(d) timeâ€”linear in the dimension of the input attributes.

For another related example, also consider K(Â·, Â·) deï¬ned by

and the parameter c controls the relative weighting between the xi (ï¬rst
order) and the xixj (second order) terms.

k

More broadly, the kernel K(x, z) = (xT z + c)k corresponds to a feature
mapping to an (cid:0)d+k
(cid:1) feature space, corresponding of all monomials of the
form xi1xi2 . . . xik that are up to order k. However, despite working in this
O(dk)-dimensional space, computing K(x, z) still takes only O(d) time, and
hence we never need to explicitly represent feature vectors in this very high
dimensional feature space.

Kernels as similarity metrics. Now, letâ€™s talk about a slightly diï¬€erent
view of kernels. Intuitively, (and there are things wrong with this intuition,
but nevermind), if Ï†(x) and Ï†(z) are close together, then we might expect
K(x, z) = Ï†(x)T Ï†(z) to be large. Conversely, if Ï†(x) and Ï†(z) are far apartâ€”
say nearly orthogonal to each otherâ€”then K(x, z) = Ï†(x)T Ï†(z) will be small.
So, we can think of K(x, z) as some measurement of how similar are Ï†(x)
and Ï†(z), or of how similar are x and z.

Given this intuition, suppose that for some learning problem that youâ€™re
working on, youâ€™ve come up with some function K(x, z) that you think might
be a reasonable measure of how similar x and z are. For instance, perhaps
you chose

K(x, z) = exp

âˆ’

(cid:18)

||x âˆ’ z||2
2Ïƒ2

(cid:19)

.

This is a reasonable measure of x and zâ€™s similarity, and is close to 1 when
x and z are close, and near 0 when x and z are far apart. Does there exist

56

a feature map Ï† such that the kernel K deï¬ned above satisï¬es K(x, z) =
Ï†(x)T Ï†(z)? In this particular example, the answer is yes. This kernel is called
the Gaussian kernel, and corresponds to an inï¬nite dimensional feature
mapping Ï†. We will give a precise characterization about what properties
a function K needs to satisfy so that it can be a valid kernel function that
corresponds to some feature map Ï†.

Necessary conditions for valid kernels. Suppose for now that K is
indeed a valid kernel corresponding to some feature mapping Ï†, and we will
ï¬rst see what properties it satisï¬es. Now, consider some ï¬nite set of n points
(not necessarily the training set) {x(1), . . . , x(n)}, and let a square, n-by-n
matrix K be deï¬ned so that its (i, j)-entry is given by Kij = K(x(i), x(j)).
This matrix is called the kernel matrix. Note that weâ€™ve overloaded the
notation and used K to denote both the kernel function K(x, z) and the
kernel matrix K, due to their obvious close relationship.

Now, if K is a valid kernel, then Kij = K(x(i), x(j)) = Ï†(x(i))T Ï†(x(j)) =
Ï†(x(j))T Ï†(x(i)) = K(x(j), x(i)) = Kji, and hence K must be symmetric. More-
over, letting Ï†k(x) denote the k-th coordinate of the vector Ï†(x), we ï¬nd that
for any vector z, we have

zT Kz =

The second-to-last step uses the fact that (cid:80)
i ai)2 for ai =
ziÏ†k(x(i)). Since z was arbitrary, this shows that K is positive semi-deï¬nite
(K â‰¥ 0).

i,j aiaj = ((cid:80)

Hence, weâ€™ve shown that if K is a valid kernel (i.e., if it corresponds to
some feature mapping Ï†), then the corresponding kernel matrix K âˆˆ RnÃ—n
is symmetric positive semideï¬nite.

57

Suï¬ƒcient conditions for valid kernels. More generally, the condition
above turns out to be not only a necessary, but also a suï¬ƒcient, condition
for K to be a valid kernel (also called a Mercer kernel). The following result
is due to Mercer.3

Theorem (Mercer). Let K : Rd Ã— Rd (cid:55)â†’ R be given. Then for K
to be a valid (Mercer) kernel, it is necessary and suï¬ƒcient that for any
{x(1), . . . , x(n)}, (n < âˆž), the corresponding kernel matrix is symmetric pos-
itive semi-deï¬nite.

Given a function K, apart from trying to ï¬nd a feature mapping Ï† that
corresponds to it, this theorem therefore gives another way of testing if it is
a valid kernel. Youâ€™ll also have a chance to play with these ideas more in
problem set 2.

In class, we also brieï¬‚y talked about a couple of other examples of ker-
nels. For instance, consider the digit recognition problem, in which given
an image (16x16 pixels) of a handwritten digit (0-9), we have to ï¬gure out
which digit it was. Using either a simple polynomial kernel K(x, z) = (xT z)k
or the Gaussian kernel, SVMs were able to obtain extremely good perfor-
mance on this problem. This was particularly surprising since the input
attributes x were just 256-dimensional vectors of the image pixel intensity
values, and the system had no prior knowledge about vision, or even about
which pixels are adjacent to which other ones. Another example that we
brieï¬‚y talked about in lecture was that if the objects x that we are trying
to classify are strings (say, x is a list of amino acids, which strung together
form a protein), then it seems hard to construct a reasonable, â€œsmallâ€ set of
features for most learning algorithms, especially if diï¬€erent strings have dif-
ferent lengths. However, consider letting Ï†(x) be a feature vector that counts
the number of occurrences of each length-k substring in x. If weâ€™re consid-
ering strings of English letters, then there are 26k such strings. Hence, Ï†(x)
is a 26k dimensional vector; even for moderate values of k, this is probably
too big for us to eï¬ƒciently work with. (e.g., 264 â‰ˆ 460000.) However, using
(dynamic programming-ish) string matching algorithms, it is possible to ef-
ï¬ciently compute K(x, z) = Ï†(x)T Ï†(z), so that we can now implicitly work
in this 26k-dimensional feature space, but without ever explicitly computing
feature vectors in this space.

3Many texts present Mercerâ€™s theorem in a slightly more complicated form involving
L2 functions, but when the input attributes take values in Rd, the
